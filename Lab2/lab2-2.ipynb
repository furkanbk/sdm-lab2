However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices., DOI: 10.3390/s21175948, Keywords: models,insect,using,nir,inputs,r,predict,data,coupled,machine,learning,ml,system,presence,paper,results,developed,based,classification,regression, Title: Early Detection of Aphid Infestation and Insect-Plant Interaction Assessment in Wheat Using a Low-Cost Electronic Nose (E-Nose), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Machine Learning Modeling, Year: 2021\n",

This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices., DOI: 10.3390/s21175948, Keywords: models,insect,using,nir,inputs,r,predict,data,coupled,machine,learning,ml,system,presence,paper,results,developed,based,classification,regression, Title: Early Detection of Aphid Infestation and Insect-Plant Interaction Assessment in Wheat Using a Low-Cost Electronic Nose (E-Nose), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Machine Learning Modeling-4, Year: 2021\n",

In the first more classical framework, we show that time-abstract bisimulation is not adequate for solving this problem, although it is sufficient in the case of timed automata . That is why we consider an other equivalence, namely the suffix equivalence based on the encoding of trajectories through words. We show that this suffix equivalence is in general a correct abstraction for games. We apply this result to o-minimal hybrid systems, and get decidability and computability results in this framework. For the second framework which assumes a partial observation of the dynamics of the system, we propose another abstraction, called the superword encoding, which is suitable to solve the games under that assumption.

Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The \"Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis\" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior., DOI: 10.1109/TENCON.2005.300837, Keywords: find,scheduling,use,learning,ml,cpu,behavior,programs,linux,analysis,static,dynamic,attributes,processes,process,tat,context,execution,work,machine, Title: Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Improve Linux Process Scheduling, Year: 2005\n",

Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time).

The availability of educational serious games offering a high-fidelity, three-dimensional environment in combination with profound medical background is limited, and most published studies have assessed student satisfaction rather than learning outcome as a function of game use. Objective This study aimed to test the effect of a serious game simulating an emergency department (“EMERGE”) on students’ declarative and procedural knowledge, as well as their satisfaction with the serious game. Methods This nonrandomized trial was performed at the Department of General, Visceral and Cancer Surgery at University Hospital Cologne, Germany. A total of 140 medical students in the clinical part of their training (5th to 12th semester) self-selected to participate in this experimental study. Declarative knowledge (measured with 20 multiple choice questions) and procedural knowledge (measured with written questions derived from an Objective Structured Clinical Examination station) were assessed before and after working with EMERGE. Students’ impression of the effectiveness and applicability of EMERGE were measured on a 6-point Likert scale. Results A pretest-posttest comparison yielded a significant increase in declarative knowledge. The percentage of correct answers to multiple choice questions increased from before (mean 60.4, SD 16.6) to after (mean 76.0, SD 11.6) playing EMERGE (P<.001). The effect on declarative knowledge was larger in students in lower semesters than in students in higher semesters (P<.001). Additionally, students’ overall impression of EMERGE was positive.

In the current era, artificial intelligence is redefining the limits of the financial markets based on state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. There is extensive use of these techniques in financial instrument price prediction, market trend analysis, establishing investment opportunities, portfolio optimization, etc. Investors and traders are using machine learning and deep learning models for forecasting financial instrument movements. With the widespread adoption of AI in finance, it is imperative to summarize the recent machine learning and deep learning models, which motivated us to present this comprehensive review of the practical applications of machine learning in the financial industry.

The idea is to learn to re-synthesize images by training on pairs of images with known disparities between gaze directions. We show that such learning-based re-synthesis can achieve convincing gaze redirection based on monocular input, and that the learned systems generalize well to people and imaging conditions unseen during training. We describe and compare three instantiations of our idea. The first system is based on efficient decision forest predictors and redirects the gaze by a fixed angle in real-time (on a single CPU), being particularly suitable for the videoconferencing gaze correction. The second system is based on a deep architecture and allows gaze redirection by a range of angles. The second system achieves higher photorealism, while being several times slower. The third system is based on real-time decision forests at test time, while using the supervision from a “teacher” deep network during training. The third system approaches the quality of a teacher network in our experiments, and thus provides a highly realistic real-time monocular solution to the gaze correction problem.

Uniquely, infectious disease testing is technologically diverse spaces in laboratory medicine, where multiple platforms and approaches may be required to support clinical decision-making. Despite advances in laboratory informatics, the vast array of infectious disease data is constrained by human analytical limitations. Machine learning can exploit multiple data streams, including but not limited to laboratory information and overcome human limitations to provide physicians with predictive and actionable results. As a quickly evolving area of computer science, laboratory professionals should become aware of AI/ML applications for infectious disease testing as more platforms are become commercially available. Content In this review we: (a) define both AI/ML, (b) provide an overview of common ML approaches used in laboratory medicine, (c) describe the current AI/ML landscape as it relates infectious disease testing, and (d) discuss the future evolution AI/ML for infectious disease testing in both laboratory and point-of-care applications. Summary The review provides an important educational overview of AI/ML technique in the context of infectious disease testing. This includes supervised ML approaches, which are frequently used in laboratory medicine applications including infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, sepsis, hepatitis, malaria, meningitis, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis. We also apply the concept of “data fusion” describing the future of laboratory testing where multiple data streams are integrated by AI/ML to provide actionable clinical knowledge., DOI: 10.1093/clinchem/hvab239, Keywords: infectious,disease,laboratory,testing,data,ml,medicine,multiple,approaches,provide,applications,machine,learning,platforms,clinical,human,limitations,streams,including,actionable, Title: Evolving Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Infectious Diseases Testing, Year: 2021\n",

Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs.

A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system., DOI: 10.3390/APP8081280, Keywords: sitting,posture,system,children,postures,algorithms,chair,postural,habit,childhood,monitoring,classifying,machine,neural,network,cnn,algorithm,data,cushion,sensor, Title: Classification of Children’s Sitting Postures Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Year: 2018\n",

It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system., DOI: 10.3390/APP8081280, Keywords: sitting,posture,system,children,postures,algorithms,chair,postural,habit,childhood,monitoring,classifying,machine,neural,network,cnn,algorithm,data,cushion,sensor, Title: Classification of Children’s Sitting Postures Using Machine Learning Algorithms-3, Year: 2018\n",

The W3C RDB2RDF Working Group is in the process of ratifying two standards to map relational databases to RDF: Direct Mapping and R2RML mapping language.

Here we investigated a variety of methods, including kernel‐based, tree, linear, neural networks, and both greedy and linear ensemble methods. These were all tested against a standardised methodology for regression with data relevant to the pharmaceutical development process. This investigation focused on QSPR problems within drug‐like chemical space. We aimed to investigate which methods perform best, and how the ‘wisdom of crowds’ principle can be applied to ensemble predictors. It was found that no single method performs best for all problems, but that a dynamic, well‐structured ensemble predictor would perform very well across the board, usually providing an improvement in performance over the best single method. Its use of weighting factors allows the greedy ensemble to acquire a bigger contribution from the better performing models, and this helps the greedy ensemble generally to outperform the simpler linear ensemble.

Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model’s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents., DOI: 10.3390/s22051721, Keywords: classification,radar,restroom,using,system,behaviors,doppler,machine,methods,results,human,learning,including,cnn,data,features,accuracy,fall,monitoring,study, Title: Machine Learning-Based Classification of Human Behaviors and Falls in Restroom via Dual Doppler Radar Measurements, Year: 2022\n",

Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents., DOI: 10.3390/s22051721, Keywords: classification,radar,restroom,using,system,behaviors,doppler,machine,methods,results,human,learning,including,cnn,data,features,accuracy,fall,monitoring,study, Title: Machine Learning-Based Classification of Human Behaviors and Falls in Restroom via Dual Doppler Radar Measurements-7, Year: 2022\n",

The proposed iShare framework leverages the Blockchain concept used in Bitcoin systems where multiple organizations/agencies participate for information sharing (without violating their privacy) to secure and monitor their cyberspace. Note that the Bitcoin for financial transactions has already demonstrated that there is a trusted, auditable sharing with peer-to-peer communications accompanied by a public ledger. The main aim of the Blockchain-based iShare framework is to constantly collect high-resolution, cyber-attack information across organizational boundaries of which the organizations have no specific knowledge or control over any other organizations’ data or damage caused by cyber-attacks. In the proposed iShare framework, the decentralized nature of the Blockchain and digitally signed transactions ensure that an adversary cannot pose as a legitimate organization/user or cannot control/hamper the system because of the digital-signatures and cannot learn anything from the public ledger that has just hashed pointers.

Keeping the strategic form of the stage game fixed, we examine the behavior of subjects when information about past actions is perfect (perfect monitoring), noisy but public (public monitoring), and noisy and private (private monitoring). We find that the subjects sustain cooperation in every treatment, but that their strategies differ across the three treatments. Specifically, the strategies under imperfect monitoring are both more complex and more lenient than those under perfect monitoring. The results show how the changes in strategies across monitoring structures mitigate the effect of noise in monitoring on efficiency.

Goal recognition, which aims to accurately recognize players' goals from observations of low-level player actions, is a key problem in player modeling. However, player goal recognition poses significant challenges because of the inherent complexity and uncertainty pervading gameplay. In this paper, we formulate player goal recognition as a sequence labeling task and introduce a goal recognition framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Results show that LSTM-based goal recognition is significantly more accurate than previous state-of-the-art methods, including n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks pre-trained with stacked denoising autoencoders, as well as Markov logic network-based models.

However, such gains from collaboration do not come for free. There are costs for such collaboration incurred by each node (e.g. energy consumption for forwarding other nodes packets). In this paper we use constrained coalitional games (i.e. collaborative dynamic games subject to constraints or costs for collaboration) to investigate several key problems in autonomic wireless networks including: network formation, efficient topologies and stability of coalitions., DOI: 10.1109/WIOPT.2007.4480056, Keywords: collaboration,nodes,autonomic,networks,costs,games,depend,functionalities,even,modeled,selfish,gain,sense,accomplish,functionality,performance,impossible,achieve,without,however, Title: Fundamental Tradeoffs and Constrained Coalitional Games in Autonomic Wireless Networks-5, Year: 2007\n",

Aside from being received well by players, great collaborative games also offer the potential to train their players’ ability to work in teams. However, some other games include additional players without adapting their design appropriately, which may lead to games where the players hardly interact with each other and with little to none benefit when another player is present. This paper aims to improve this situation by introducing game design patterns for collaborative player interactions. Being extracted from well-received games, these patterns can be used as guidance for collaborative game designs fostering interaction between players. The interactions are classified along several dimensions (e.g. spatial and temporal) and can therefore be easily selected for specific situations.

In this paper, we focus on a simple, yet widely adopted, setup in which a fusion center (FC) is asked to make a binary decision about a sequence of system states by relying on the possibly corrupted decisions provided by local nodes. We propose a game-theoretic framework, which permits to exploit the superior performance provided by optimum decision fusion, while limiting the amount of a priori knowledge required. We use numerical simulations to derive the optimum behavior of the FC and the Byzantines in a game-theoretic sense, and to evaluate the achievable performance at the equilibrium point of the game. We analyze several different setups, showing that in all cases, the proposed solution permits to improve the accuracy of data fusion.

Often, the cut-scene gives narrative shape to the game experience, moving the player along through a series of events culminating in the story's end. Cybertheorists such as Hayles, Murray and Frasca have explored the ways in which digital interactive media and the video game introduce new paradigms of narrative and storytelling, as well new conceptions of interactivity and agency. However, in many ways the inclusion of cut-scenes raises many of the problems concerning the theoretical structures with which to investigate video games. Since cut-scenes often follow cinematic codes of representation, current theory often renders the cut-scene as passive and non-interactive, as opposed to the interactive nature of gameplay. Yet as film theory has shown, especially in the effects of suturing and such, cinema offers a kind of psychic interactivity that blurs the hard boundary often drawn between cinema and gameplay. The cut-scene then becomes the locus of the tension in video games between cinematic representation and gameplay, and subsequently, an investigation of the cut-scene and its role in the video game can offer substantial insight into the nature of agency and interactivity within the video game. Using the release of Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 and Ubisoft’s Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, both of which challenge the traditional definitions and uses of the cutscene, this paper will study the different ways in which the cut-scene operates within the video game. It will not only discuss current conceptions of agency and interactivity within the video game, but also offer an transmedia framework, after the work of Marsha Kinder, with which to explore the relationship between narrative and gameplay, cinema and simulation in the video game., DOI: , Keywords: video,game,often,interactivity,gameplay,many,games,narrative,ways,agency,cinema,within,since,cutscene,interactive,new,conceptions,cinematic,representation,current, Title: Waiting for Something to Happen: Narratives, Interactivity and Agency and the Video Game Cut-scene, Year: 2007\n",

However, in many ways the inclusion of cut-scenes raises many of the problems concerning the theoretical structures with which to investigate video games. Since cut-scenes often follow cinematic codes of representation, current theory often renders the cut-scene as passive and non-interactive, as opposed to the interactive nature of gameplay. Yet as film theory has shown, especially in the effects of suturing and such, cinema offers a kind of psychic interactivity that blurs the hard boundary often drawn between cinema and gameplay. The cut-scene then becomes the locus of the tension in video games between cinematic representation and gameplay, and subsequently, an investigation of the cut-scene and its role in the video game can offer substantial insight into the nature of agency and interactivity within the video game. Using the release of Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 and Ubisoft’s Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, both of which challenge the traditional definitions and uses of the cutscene, this paper will study the different ways in which the cut-scene operates within the video game.

The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a public data source that maintains standardized information about reported software vulnerabilities. Since its inception in 1997, NVD has published information about more than 43,000 software vulnerabilities affecting more than 17,000 software applications. This information is potentially valuable in understanding trends and patterns in software vulnerabilities so that one can better manage the security of computer systems that are pestered by the ubiquitous software security flaws. In particular, one would like to be able to predict the likelihood that a piece of software contains a yet-to-be-discovered vulnerability, which must be taken into account in security management due to the increasing trend in zero-day attacks. We conducted an empirical study on applying data-mining techniques on NVD data with the objective of predicting the time to next vulnerability for a given software application. We experimented with various features constructed using the information available in NVD and applied various machine learning algorithms to examine the predictive power of the data. Our results show that the data in NVD generally have poor prediction capability, with the exception of a few vendors and software applications. We suggest possible reasons for why the NVD data have not produced a reasonable prediction model for time to next vulnerability with our current approach, and suggest alternative ways in which the data in NVD can be used for the purpose of risk estimation., DOI: 10.1080/19393555.2015.1111961, Keywords: software,nvd,data,vulnerabilities,security,vulnerability,information,applications,one,time,next,various,prediction,suggest,abstract,major,cause,cyber,problems,national, Title: Predicting Cyber Risks through National Vulnerability Database, Year: 2015\n",

We suggest possible reasons for why the NVD data have not produced a reasonable prediction model for time to next vulnerability with our current approach, and suggest alternative ways in which the data in NVD can be used for the purpose of risk estimation., DOI: 10.1080/19393555.2015.1111961, Keywords: software,nvd,data,vulnerabilities,security,vulnerability,information,applications,one,time,next,various,prediction,suggest,abstract,major,cause,cyber,problems,national, Title: Predicting Cyber Risks through National Vulnerability Database-8, Year: 2015\n",

In grids there exist users and service providers. The service providers provide the service for jobs that the users generate. Typically the amount of jobs generated by all the users are more than any single provider can handle alone with any acceptable quality of service (QoS). As such, the service providers need to cooperate and allocate jobs among them so that each is providing an acceptable QoS to their customers. QoS is of particular concerns to service providers as it directly affects customers' satisfaction and loyalty. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic solution to the QoS sensitive, grid job allocation problem. We model the QoS based, grid job allocation problem as a cooperative game and present the structure of the Nash Bargaining Solution. The proposed algorithm is fair to all users and represents a Pareto optimal solution to the QoS objective. One advantage of our scheme is the relatively low overhead and robust performance against inaccuracies in performance prediction information., DOI: 10.1109/TC.2008.79, Keywords: service,qos,users,providers,grid,performance,jobs,solution,computing,nodes,acceptable,customers,game,job,allocation,problem,differs,traditional,high,systems, Title: A Cooperative Game Framework for QoS Guided Job Allocation Schemes in Grids, Year: 2008\n",

However, it has proven to be hard not only to modify the capture data without losing its reality but also to search for the required capture data in a lot of capture data. In this paper, we provide a solution to these problems based on our previous work on symbolization of motion patterns for developing humanoid intelligence. Similar motion sequences in the database are abstracted as a symbol, which will be applied to searching motion patterns in the database similar to a given motion. This paper also introduces a method for building a stochastic symbol-word mapping model utilizing the word labels provided by the operator during motion capture sessions. This model converts a input sequence of words into a sequence of symbols, and then allows the capture database both to be searched for capture data corresponding to the input (a sequence of words) and to provide the users with new motion data generated by the symbols. Finally, we apply analogy of symbols to establishing the database in order to provide an appropriate motion data in response to an unsupervised sequence of words and then demonstrate the validity of analogy theory., DOI: 10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363942, Keywords: motion,capture,data,database,sequence,provide,words,symbols,humanoid,also,paper,patterns,similar,model,input,analogy,systems,used,obtain,robots, Title: Capture Database through Symbolization, Recognition and Generation of Motion Patterns, Year: 2007\n",

There is a special source node and each player is interested in connecting to the source by making a routing decision that minimizes its payment. The mutual influence of the players is determined by a cost sharing mechanism, which in our case evenly splits the cost of an edge among the players using it. We consider two different models: an integral model, where each player connects to the source by choosing a single path, and a fractional model, where a player is allowed to split the flow it receives from the source between several paths. In both models we explore the overhead incurred in network cost due to the selfish behavior of the users, as well as the computational complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium. The existence of a Nash equilibrium for the integral model was previously established by the means of a potential function. We prove that finding a Nash equilibrium that minimizes the potential function is NP-hard. We focus on the price of anarchy of a Nash equilibrium resulting from the best-response dynamics of a game course, where the players join the game sequentially. For a game with in players, we establish an upper bound of O(radicnlog2 n) on the price of anarchy, and a lower bound of Omega(log n/log log n). For the fractional model, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium via a potential function and give a polynomial time algorithm for computing an equilibrium that minimizes the potential function. Finally, we consider a weighted extension of the multicast game, and prove that in the fractional model, the game always has a Nash equilibrium., DOI: 10.1145/1134707.1134716, Keywords: equilibrium,game,nash,players,model,source,potential,function,consider,player,minimizes,cost,fractional,prove,multicast,selfish,models,integral,finding,existence, Title: Non-Cooperative Multicast and Facility Location Games, Year: 2006\n",

There is a special source node and each player is interested in connecting to the source by making a routing decision that minimizes its payment. The mutual influence of the players is determined by a cost sharing mechanism, which in our case evenly splits the cost of an edge among the players using it. We consider two different models: an integral model, where each player connects to the source by choosing a single path, and a fractional model, where a player is allowed to split the flow it receives from the source between several paths. In both models we explore the overhead incurred in network cost due to the selfish behavior of the users, as well as the computational complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium. The existence of a Nash equilibrium for the integral model was previously established by the means of a potential function.

This paper presents the results of a study that attempts to quantify the effectiveness of computer games as programming projects over non-games. Students completed five major programming assignments during the semester in an introductory programming course. For each assignment, students were given an option between two programming projects, a game and a non-game. Throughout the term, 78.9% of the assignments submitted by students were the game option. The average grade, however, on game assignments was 89.1%, while the non-game average was 95.1%. In a post-term survey 84% of student respondents answered \"yes\" to the question, \"Did the games provide any extra motivation for you to complete the projects with a high level of quality?\" Results suggest that games do indeed provide psychological motivation and increase course enjoyment, even though they may not improve students' scores, DOI: 10.1109/FIE.2006.322314, Keywords: programming,games,assignments,students,projects,game,computer,introductory,results,course,option,average,provide,motivation,often,cited,motivational,tool,used,courses, Title: The Effectiveness of Games as Assignments in an Introductory Programming Course, Year: 2006\n",

However, it is difficult to extract meaningful data without blueprints because the table inside the database has exceedingly complicated relation and the role of the table and field in the table was so ambiguous. If we don't obtain the database's database or even if we get, but don't understand relationship in the table and meaning of each field, we cannot obtain the significant evidences. Therefore, the investigator should confirm the contents of the database blueprints and check the relationship between the table and hidden table which unsigned blueprints. In this paper, we improve the DBRE (database reverse engineering) process and analyze the table relationship of database and data extraction method in the view of the digital forensics.

In the field of model checking, abstraction has proved an extremely successful tool to combat the state-space explosion problem. In the probabilistic setting, however, little practical progress has been made in this area. We propose an abstraction method for MDPs based on stochastic two-player games. The key idea behind this approach is to maintain a separation between nondeterminism present in the original MDP and nondeterminism introduced through abstraction, each type being represented by a different player in the game. Crucially, this allows us to obtain distinct lower and upper bounds for both the best and worst-case performance (minimum or maximum probabilities) of the MDP.

In many cases, the employed security solutions are ad hoc and lack a quantitative decision framework. While they are effective in solving the particular problems they are designed for, they generally fail to respond well in a dynamically changing scenario. To this end, we propose a holistic security approach in this paper. We find that game theory provides huge potential to place such an approach on a solid analytical setting. We consider the interaction between the attacks and the defense mechanisms as a game played between the attacker and the defender (system administrator). In particular, we propose a game theory inspired defense architecture in which a game model acts as the brain. We focus on one of our recently proposed game models, namely imperfect information stochastic game.

In many cases, the employed security solutions are ad hoc and lack a quantitative decision framework. While they are effective in solving the particular problems they are designed for, they generally fail to respond well in a dynamically changing scenario. To this end, we propose a holistic security approach in this paper. We find that game theory provides huge potential to place such an approach on a solid analytical setting. We consider the interaction between the attacks and the defense mechanisms as a game played between the attacker and the defender (system administrator). In particular, we propose a game theory inspired defense architecture in which a game model acts as the brain. We focus on one of our recently proposed game models, namely imperfect information stochastic game.

The attention mechanism of the model focuses on emotion-related elements of the IS09 and mel spectrogram feature and the emotion-related duration from the time of the feature. Thus, the model extracts emotion information from a given speech signal. The proposed model for the baseline study achieved a weighted accuracy (WA) of 68% for the improvised dataset of IEMOCAP. However, the WA of the proposed model of the main study and modified models could not achieve more than 68% in the improvised dataset. This is because of the reliability limit of the IEMOCAP dataset. A more reliable dataset is required for a more accurate evaluation of the model’s performance.

However, the WA of the proposed model of the main study and modified models could not achieve more than 68% in the improvised dataset. This is because of the reliability limit of the IEMOCAP dataset. A more reliable dataset is required for a more accurate evaluation of the model’s performance.

Our work is motivated by the fact that existing models are often tested only on datasets that require excessively high-level reasoning or mostly contain instances accessible through single frame inferences. Hence, it is difficult to measure capacity and flexibility of trained models, and existing techniques often rely on adhoc implementations of deep neural networks without clear insight into datasets and models. We are particularly interested in understanding temporal relationships between video events to solve VideoQA problems; this is because reasoning temporal dependency is one of the most distinct components in videos from images. To address this objective, we automatically generate a customized synthetic VideoQA dataset using Super Mario Bros. gameplay videos so that it contains events with different levels of reasoning complexity. Using the dataset, we show that properly constructed datasets with events in various complexity levels are critical to learn effective models and improve overall performance., DOI: 10.1109/ICCV.2017.312, Keywords: models,datasets,videoqa,using,videos,reasoning,events,various,video,synthetic,constructed,automatically,gameplay,existing,often,temporal,dataset,levels,complexity,present, Title: MarioQA: Answering Questions by Watching Gameplay Videos, Year: 2016\n",

This paper discusses the quantitative comparison of performance between the SQL (i.e., PostGIS) and NoSQL (i.e., MongoDB) databases in handling geospatial big data. A NodeJS-based angular-framework web app was developed to test the real-world performance of MongoDB and PostGIS in handling a large amount of simulated geospatial data.

This paper discusses the quantitative comparison of performance between the SQL (i.e., PostGIS) and NoSQL (i.e., MongoDB) databases in handling geospatial big data. A NodeJS-based angular-framework web app was developed to test the real-world performance of MongoDB and PostGIS in handling a large amount of simulated geospatial data. A different number of points were generated for testing the geospatial data storing and loading capability of both the databases. The test was conducted by comparing the result of XHR (XML HTTP Request) of both databases in each case. The result showed that NoSQL database, i.e. MongoDB, performs better in loading big geospatial data compared to traditional SQL database using PostGIS., DOI: 10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528705, Keywords: data,geospatial,big,databases,sql,nosql,database,handling,postgis,mongodb,large,amount,better,storing,performance,test,loading,result,last,decade, Title: Testing Spatial Data Deliverance in SQL and NoSQL Database Using NodeJS Fullstack Web App-3, Year: 2018\n",

Biological information curated for these data objects includes disease associations, phenotypes, pathways, molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. RGD uses more than a dozen different ontologies to standardize annotation information for genes, QTLs and strains. That means a lot of time can be spent searching and browsing ontologies for the appropriate terms needed both for curating and mining the data. RGD has upgraded its ontology term search to make it more versatile and more robust. A term search result is connected to a term browser so the user can fine-tune the search by viewing parent and children terms. Most publicly available term browsers display a hierarchical organization of terms in an expandable tree format. RGD has replaced its old tree browser format with a ‘driller’ type of browser that allows quicker drilling up and down through the term branches, which has been confirmed by testing. The RGD ontology report pages have also been upgraded. Expanded functionality allows more choice in how annotations are displayed and what subsets of annotations are displayed. The new ontology search, browser and report features have been designed to enhance both manual data curation and manual data extraction.

We propose an architecture that generalizes multidatabase technology and consists of a global coordinator and local specialized agents, one for each subsystem to be coordinated. The agent associated to a subsystem not only monitors relevant subsystem activity but also guarantees certain properties of operations executed in a subsystem. Therefore, it has to provide database functionality for subsystems even in cases they do not rest upon databases. The coordination itself is a synthesis of (advanced) transaction models and workflows. Aside from an introduction to the transactional coordination model, we concentrate in this paper on the analysis of different classes of subsystems and elaborate on properties required from the subsystem and its agent to ensure execution guarantees.

The agent associated to a subsystem not only monitors relevant subsystem activity but also guarantees certain properties of operations executed in a subsystem. Therefore, it has to provide database functionality for subsystems even in cases they do not rest upon databases. The coordination itself is a synthesis of (advanced) transaction models and workflows. Aside from an introduction to the transactional coordination model, we concentrate in this paper on the analysis of different classes of subsystems and elaborate on properties required from the subsystem and its agent to ensure execution guarantees. Furthermore, we examine to which degree database functionality can be provided for application systems with a given set of properties. Our examples are taken from an industrial project in the area of computer integrated manufacturing. ∗This work has been partially supported by the Swiss Commission of Technology and Innovation (KTI) under contract number 3008.2 †Present address: Credit Suisse, Advanced Technologies, Postfach 100, CH–8070 Zurich, DOI: , Keywords: subsystem,coordination,subsystems,properties,application,technology,agent,guarantees,database,functionality,advanced,c,simulation,councils,cim,means,enforcing,dependencies,autonomous,propose, Title: Coordination in CIM:Bringing Database Functionality to Application Systems-2, Year: 1998\n",

In this paper, we present STREETS, an application developed for the city of Singapore, which models the problem of computing randomized traffic patrol strategies as a defenderattacker Stackelberg game. Previous work on Stackelberg security games has focused extensively on counterterrorism settings. STREETS moves beyond counterterrorism and represents the first use of Stackelberg games for traffic patrolling, in the process providing a novel algorithm for solving such games that addresses three major challenges in modeling and scale-up. First, there exists a high degree of unpredictability in travel times through road networks, which we capture using a Markov Decision Process for planning the patrols of the defender (the police) in the game. Second, modeling all possible police patrols and their interactions with a large number of adversaries (drivers) introduces a significant scalability challenge. To address this challenge we apply a compact game representation in a novel fashion combined with adversary and state sampling. Third, patrol strategies must balance exploitation (minimizing violations) with exploration (maximizing omnipresence), a tradeoff we model by solving a biobjective optimization problem.

To address this challenge we apply a compact game representation in a novel fashion combined with adversary and state sampling. Third, patrol strategies must balance exploitation (minimizing violations) with exploration (maximizing omnipresence), a tradeoff we model by solving a biobjective optimization problem.

To increase the probability of success in examinations, many instructors will employ a review session to prepare their students. The type of review session may vary from a laundry list of potential test topics to mock examinations. In order to provide the clarity that a student needs, instructors must structure their review session to enable their students to not only understand the material, but also be able to apply the material to new situations that they may encounter on the examination and even beyond the classroom. One interesting way that we used to review material that provided insight and interaction and even injected some fun into learning was by using a variation of the “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ” television game show to conduct midterm and final review sessions in both undergraduate and MBA operations management courses.

Much recent work has focused on increasing the size of an extensive game that can be feasibly solved. Despite these improvements, many interesting games are still too large for such techniques. A common approach for computing strategies in these large games is to first employ an abstraction technique to reduce the original game to an abstract game that is of a manageable size. This abstract game is then solved and the resulting strategy is played in the original game. Most top programs in recent AAAI Computer Poker Competitions use this approach. The trend in this competition has been that strategies found in larger abstract games tend to beat strategies found in smaller abstract games. These larger abstract games have more expressive strategy spaces and therefore contain better strategies. In this paper we present a new method for computing strategies in large games. This method allows us to compute more expressive strategies without increasing the size of abstract games that we are required to solve. We demonstrate the power of the approach experimentally in both small and large games, while also providing a theoretical justification for the resulting improvement., DOI: , Keywords: games,strategies,abstract,game,large,size,approach,extensive,recent,increasing,solved,computing,original,resulting,strategy,found,larger,expressive,method,often, Title: Strategy Grafting in Extensive Games, Year: 2009\n",

This article outlines a framework for analysing types of individual development of creative performance based on neural networks. Therefore, two kinds of sport-specific training programme for the learning of game creativity in real field contexts were investigated. Two training groups (soccer, n = 20; field hockey, n = 17) but not a control group (n = 18) improved with respect to three measuring points (P < 0.001), although no difference could be established between the two training groups (P = 0.212). By using neural networks it is now possible to distinguish between five types of learning behaviour in the development of performance, the most striking ones being what we call “up-down” and “down-up”. In the field hockey group in particular, an up-down fluctuation process was identified, whereby creative performance increases initially, but at the end is worse than in the middle of the training programme. The reverse down-up fluctuation process was identified mainly in the soccer group. The results are discussed with regard to recent training explanation models, such as the super-compensation theory, with a view to further development of neural network applications., DOI: 10.1080/02640410802442007, Keywords: training,creative,development,performance,neural,two,field,n,group,behaviour,types,networks,programme,learning,groups,soccer,hockey,p,fluctuation,process, Title: Game creativity analysis using neural networks, Year: 2009\n",

Therefore, two kinds of sport-specific training programme for the learning of game creativity in real field contexts were investigated. Two training groups (soccer, n = 20; field hockey, n = 17) but not a control group (n = 18) improved with respect to three measuring points (P < 0.001), although no difference could be established between the two training groups (P = 0.212). By using neural networks it is now possible to distinguish between five types of learning behaviour in the development of performance, the most striking ones being what we call “up-down” and “down-up”. In the field hockey group in particular, an up-down fluctuation process was identified, whereby creative performance increases initially, but at the end is worse than in the middle of the training programme. The reverse down-up fluctuation process was identified mainly in the soccer group. The results are discussed with regard to recent training explanation models, such as the super-compensation theory, with a view to further development of neural network applications., DOI: 10.1080/02640410802442007, Keywords: training,creative,development,performance,neural,two,field,n,group,behaviour,types,networks,programme,learning,groups,soccer,hockey,p,fluctuation,process, Title: Game creativity analysis using neural networks-1, Year: 2009\n",

Assuming that the macrocell base station (MBS) protects itself by pricing the interference from femtocell users, a Stackelberg game is formulated to study the joint utility maximization of the macrocell and femtocells subject to a maximum tolerable interference power constraint at the MBS. Two practical femtocell network models are investigated: sparsely deployed scenario for rural areas and densely deployed scenario for urban areas. For each scenario, two pricing schemes: uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing, are proposed. The Stackelberg equilibriums for the proposed games are characterized, and an effective distributed interference price bargaining algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed for the uniform-pricing case.

Two practical femtocell network models are investigated: sparsely deployed scenario for rural areas and densely deployed scenario for urban areas. For each scenario, two pricing schemes: uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing, are proposed. The Stackelberg equilibriums for the proposed games are characterized, and an effective distributed interference price bargaining algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed for the uniform-pricing case. Numerical examples are presented to verify the proposed studies. It is shown that the proposed schemes are effective in resource allocation and macrocell protection for both the uplink and downlink transmissions in spectrum-sharing femtocell networks., DOI: 10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133874, Keywords: proposed,femtocell,macrocell,pricing,interference,scenario,resource,allocation,networks,distributed,femtocells,mbs,stackelberg,two,deployed,areas,schemes,effective,paper,investigates, Title: Price-Based Resource Allocation for Spectrum-Sharing Femtocell Networks: A Stackelberg Game Approach-4, Year: 2011\n",

      "Paper: http://www.semanticweb.org/kocak/ontologies/2024/4/AcademicPapers#Paper_0091346f761e451761f48eadd304bd3fb8a4126e, Abstract: The influence of genetics and the environment, identibing reliable pre-morbid markers, expanding syndrome profiles, building quantitative models of brain function: the current interest in databases is motivated by such scientific imperatives. It is also fueled by the improved availability of the necessary technology, and by a number of high-profile initiatives. In particular, the Human Brain Project has seeded a plethora of distributed databases across scale and species, helped develop the field of Neuroinformatics, and provided a major impetus to the development of the analytical, biocomputational modeling, simulation tools and the interoperability that will link a federation of databases to enhance hypothesis-driven, as well as discovery-driven, neuroscience (see Koslow article in this issue). A number of journals have now begun to mandate that authors of accepted papers will provide access by other scientists to the raw data upon which the report was based (for example, Van Horn et al., 2004'). There is also the emergence of a standardized international database, generated using standardized methodology in all contributing laboratories and where the data analysis is centralized (see Gordon et al. article in this issue). This development allows for the study of individual differences, multi-modal interrelationships and the specificity, or generalizability, of the findings to be examined. The increased scale of database development is also coupled to a growing demand for large-scale science. The importance of \"large-scale science\" is highlighted in a recent article by five NIH directors in Nature Neuroscience entitled: \"Limits to growth: why neuroscience needs largescale science\" (Insel et al., 20042). In this Special Issue, invited authors not only discuss the issues generally, but also showcase several ambitious databases and innovative ways to exploit them. The Australian EEG Database paper (Hunter et al ) outlines the potential outcomes from a web-based de-identified searchable database of 18,500 EEG records across a spectrum of clinical disorders. Prichep's contribution proposes methods to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of qEEG in neurobehavioral clinical patient populations with the aim of eventually defining these disorders with objective qEEG based measures. Duffy extols the clinical utility of long latency ERPs, including Z statistic significance probability mapping and BESA analysis in order to understand patientspecific sensory processing difficulties, leading to more precise case conceptualization and better defined treatment. Johnstone et al. review clinical EEG studies in neurofeedback and propose treatment interventions that are testable in databases. Saletu et al. emphasize the \"key and lock\" principle as a potential pharmaco-EEG utility for defining therapeutic approaches as well as having significant potential for pharmacologically-based studies. This information is complemented by insights from Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Thatcher et al. examine the validity of LORETA in defining patterns of abnormal qEEG activity defined by reference to a normative EEG database. Blinowska and Durka highlight the progress in the biomedical sciences for data-sharing and new EEGiERP analyses, illustrated via their EEG portal.

The Australian EEG Database paper (Hunter et al ) outlines the potential outcomes from a web-based de-identified searchable database of 18,500 EEG records across a spectrum of clinical disorders. Prichep's contribution proposes methods to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of qEEG in neurobehavioral clinical patient populations with the aim of eventually defining these disorders with objective qEEG based measures. Duffy extols the clinical utility of long latency ERPs, including Z statistic significance probability mapping and BESA analysis in order to understand patientspecific sensory processing difficulties, leading to more precise case conceptualization and better defined treatment. Johnstone et al. review clinical EEG studies in neurofeedback and propose treatment interventions that are testable in databases. Saletu et al. emphasize the \"key and lock\" principle as a potential pharmaco-EEG utility for defining therapeutic approaches as well as having significant potential for pharmacologically-based studies. This information is complemented by insights from Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Thatcher et al. examine the validity of LORETA in defining patterns of abnormal qEEG activity defined by reference to a normative EEG database. Blinowska and Durka highlight the progress in the biomedical sciences for data-sharing and new EEGiERP analyses, illustrated via their EEG portal. Databases provide enhanced statistical power from data pooling, and show promise of elucidating new patterns of interrelationships amongst data obtained from normal subjects. They will also ultimately be used in the discovery of new medical treatments and will have applications to \"Personalized Medicine,\" the study of individual subjects compared to their multi-dimensionally matched controls. We are entering a time in the history of Clinical Neuroscience (psychiatry, neurology, psychology) when we have sufficient data, as well as the availability of widely acceptable tools; so that the time is ripe to develop databased approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The active collaboration across disciplines and individual laboratories, together with support from granting agencies, may provide for the development of standard approved methods of investigation as well as clinical practice. Such developments will inexorably lead to the acceptance of qEEGbased methods and studies in training programs in all of the relevant disciplines. Microscopic reductionism will continue to be a major focus of neuroscience. However, databases of EEG and other high-level brain measures will provide a vital counterbalance by providing the foundation for a different kind, DOI: 10.1177/155005940503600203, Keywords: databases,et,eeg,clinical,also,neuroscience,data,database,al,brain,development,well,provide,across,article,issue,individual,science,potential,methods, Title: EEG Databases in Research and Clinical Practice: Current Status and Future Directions-8, Year: 2005\n",

These games promote interaction among players by offering interdependency features, but to date few studies have asked what interdependency design factors of MMORPGs make them fun for players, produce experiences of flow, or enhance player performance. In this study, we focused on two game design features: task and reward interdependency. We conducted a controlled experiment that compared the interaction effects of low and high task-interdependency conditions and low and high reward-interdependency conditions on three dependent variables: fun, flow, and performance. We found that in a low task-interdependency condition, players had more fun, experienced higher levels of flow, and perceived better performance when a low reward-interdependency condition also obtained. In contrast, in a high task-interdependency condition, all of these measures were higher when a high reward-interdependency condition also obtained., DOI: 10.1089/cpb.2007.9985, Keywords: players,low,high,condition,games,interdependency,fun,flow,performance,online,mmorpgs,interaction,features,design,conditions,higher,also,obtained,today,millions, Title: Collaborate and Share: An Experimental Study of the Effects of Task and Reward Interdependencies in Online Games, Year: 2007\n",

In PRUW, a user privately reads a submodel from a system of N databases containing M submodels, updates it locally, and writes the update back to the databases without revealing the submodel index or the value of the update. The databases considered in this problem are only allowed to store a given amount of information specified by an arbitrary storage constraint. We provide a storage mechanism that determines the contents of each database prior to the application of the PRUW scheme, such that the total communication cost is minimized. We show that the proposed storage scheme achieves a lower total cost compared to what is achieved by using coded storage or divided storage to meet the given storage constraint., DOI: 10.1109/ISIT50566.2022.9834439, Keywords: storage,databases,update,pruw,submodel,problem,given,constraint,scheme,total,cost,investigate,private,read,write,relation,federated,learning,fsl,constrained, Title: Private Read Update Write (PRUW) with Storage Constrained Databases, Year: 2022\n",

This is particularly evident when one focuses on allowing updates in logic programs. In this paper we propose a language DatalogA which is an extension of Datalog with updates to base relations. We define some procedural constructs to allow update programs to be written in an easy manner.

In these websites, reputation systems, a proved useful mechanism, is introduced to help people to decide which information deserved to trust. To maintain the overall credibility of the information, users are confronted with assessing the reliability of information from different sources. This paper presents anti-collusion algorithm, a collusive group recognition method based on game theory. In reputation systems, users forming collusive group tend to increase theirs own reputations by abusing evaluation of other users' behaviors. Anti-collusion algorithm makes a good use of the game between the members of collusive group, who have to form a special pattern of profit distribution not only on income of reputation but also on distribution of profit if they want to get the benefits from collusion.

In the game the players go through the process of inquiry similar to that of forensic experts. In this paper I present the first observations from a play test of Homicide and discuss the potential in this type of game-based learning spaces., DOI: , Keywords: learning,science,game,homicide,active,process,inquiry,paper,present,first,test,forensic,experts,recent,years,education,focus,study,development,new, Title: Learning Games as a Platform for Simulated Science Practice-8, Year: 2005\n",

Organizations must balance between the requirement for security and the desire for excellent performance. Encryption at the database level, versus application level and file level has proved to be the ideal method to protect sensitive data and deliver performance. There are a multitude of architectures and techniques to improve performance: the alternatives fall into two broad categories - alternative topologies to decrease encryption overhead and techniques to limit the number of encryption operations. In addition, performance and security, in real-world scenarios, are complex issues and experts should be used who understand all available options and the impact for each particular customer environment. Every organization must protect sensitive data or suffer potential legislative, regulatory, legal and brand consequences. Relying on perimeter security and database access control does not provide adequate security. Packaged database encryption solutions have proven to be the best alternative to protect sensitive data. This is a specialized and complex solution area and if internal resources don't have the cryptography expertise in relation to IT environment, outside expertise should be used to ensure superior performance.

In addition, performance and security, in real-world scenarios, are complex issues and experts should be used who understand all available options and the impact for each particular customer environment. Every organization must protect sensitive data or suffer potential legislative, regulatory, legal and brand consequences. Relying on perimeter security and database access control does not provide adequate security. Packaged database encryption solutions have proven to be the best alternative to protect sensitive data.

Being competitive in this industry means releasing the best possible software, and reliability is a key feature to win the market. Computer games are also actively used to simulate different robotic systems where reliability is even more important, and potentially critical. Traditional software testing approaches can check a subset of all the possible program executions, and they can never guarantee complete absence of errors in the source code. On the other hand, during more than twenty years, Model Checking has demonstrated to be a powerful instrument for formal verification of large hardware and software components. In this paper, we contribute with a novel approach to formally verify computer games. We propose a method of model construction that starts from a computer game description and utilizes Model Checking technique. We apply the method on a case study: the game Penguin Clash.

Finally, an approach to game model reduction (and its implementation) is introduced in order to address the state explosion problem., DOI: 10.1109/AINA.2018.00122, Keywords: computer,model,games,software,game,industry,possible,reliability,checking,approach,method,multiplayer,play,big,role,entertainment,competitive,means,releasing,best, Title: Model Checking in Multiplayer Games Development-8, Year: 2017\n",

Hence, needing access to such data, they have to fall back on SQL and the relational model. In this paper we describe Relational.OWL, our technique to automatically extract the semantics of relational databases and transform this information into a machine processable and understandable representation.

Forwards, illustrations, references, index. 327 pp. $29.95 cloth. ISBN: 9780262162579Celia Pearce's Communities of Play is a fascinating, wide-ranging study relevant to anyone interested in online games and worlds, ethnography, or game studies. The book tells the story of a group of players who originally met in the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) Uru Prologue and their efforts to stay together after the game closed. This work is significant for three major reasons. First, it is a study of the processes that give rise to emergent behavior in MMOs, a topic of relevance to both game designers and sociologists. Second, the book is also one of very few studies addressing how a virtual world's closing affects its players. Finally, it contains an insightful analysis of the perks and perils of doing ethnography in an online community, an analysis that is invaluable for anyone considering a similar project.Uru Prologue was intended as the beta test for Uru Live, an MMO set in the popular Myst universe. Uru Live was canceled before release, however, and Uru Prologue closed on February 9, 2004. This closure marked both the end of the beta test, the cancellation of Uru Live, and the birth of what Pearce refers to as the \"Uru Diaspora,\" a group of players who now inhabit other online spaces but still identify as Uru-vians (p. 93). The book focuses on how one particular group of players known as \"The Gathering of Uru\" (TGU) reacted to the closing and attempted to stay together.One notable theoretical tool Pearce defines early in the book is a continuum of online game types, with \"fixed-synthetic worlds\" (such as Uru and World of Warcraft) at one end and \"co-created worlds\" (such as There.com and Second Life) at the other. In the former, users have few content-creation tools, while the latter emphasize user-created content. Pearce's continuum provides a useful means of analyzing how the emergent social behavior occurring in an MMO is shaped by the affordances and constraints placed on the player. (Here \"emergence\" refers to a phenomenon whereby complex systems organize themselves and act in unpredictable ways, while \"affordances and constraints\" refer to what a given MMO does and does not allow its users to do.) For members of the TGU, the affordances of co-created worlds such as There.com and Second Life enabled them to re-create environments and objects from Uru Prologue in other virtual worlds. Pearce's identification of this phenomenon offers game designers insight into how a virtual world can be designed to support varying kinds of emergent behavior among the players. …, DOI: , Keywords: uru,worlds,pearce,game,online,players,emergent,virtual,book,mmo,prologue,group,behavior,second,one,world,live,affordances,communities,play, Title: Communities of Play: Emergent Cultures in Multiplayer Games and Virtual Worlds, Year: 2012\n",

ISBN: 9780262162579Celia Pearce's Communities of Play is a fascinating, wide-ranging study relevant to anyone interested in online games and worlds, ethnography, or game studies. The book tells the story of a group of players who originally met in the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) Uru Prologue and their efforts to stay together after the game closed. This work is significant for three major reasons. First, it is a study of the processes that give rise to emergent behavior in MMOs, a topic of relevance to both game designers and sociologists. Second, the book is also one of very few studies addressing how a virtual world's closing affects its players. Finally, it contains an insightful analysis of the perks and perils of doing ethnography in an online community, an analysis that is invaluable for anyone considering a similar project.Uru Prologue was intended as the beta test for Uru Live, an MMO set in the popular Myst universe. Uru Live was canceled before release, however, and Uru Prologue closed on February 9, 2004. This closure marked both the end of the beta test, the cancellation of Uru Live, and the birth of what Pearce refers to as the \"Uru Diaspora,\" a group of players who now inhabit other online spaces but still identify as Uru-vians (p. 93). The book focuses on how one particular group of players known as \"The Gathering of Uru\" (TGU) reacted to the closing and attempted to stay together.One notable theoretical tool Pearce defines early in the book is a continuum of online game types, with \"fixed-synthetic worlds\" (such as Uru and World of Warcraft) at one end and \"co-created worlds\" (such as There.com and Second Life) at the other. In the former, users have few content-creation tools, while the latter emphasize user-created content. Pearce's continuum provides a useful means of analyzing how the emergent social behavior occurring in an MMO is shaped by the affordances and constraints placed on the player. (Here \"emergence\" refers to a phenomenon whereby complex systems organize themselves and act in unpredictable ways, while \"affordances and constraints\" refer to what a given MMO does and does not allow its users to do.) For members of the TGU, the affordances of co-created worlds such as There.com and Second Life enabled them to re-create environments and objects from Uru Prologue in other virtual worlds. Pearce's identification of this phenomenon offers game designers insight into how a virtual world can be designed to support varying kinds of emergent behavior among the players. …, DOI: , Keywords: uru,worlds,pearce,game,online,players,emergent,virtual,book,mmo,prologue,group,behavior,second,one,world,live,affordances,communities,play, Title: Communities of Play: Emergent Cultures in Multiplayer Games and Virtual Worlds-1, Year: 2012\n",

GDB-17 was analyzed using 42 integer value descriptors of molecular structure which we term \"Molecular Quantum Numbers\" (MQN). Principal component analysis and representation of the (PC1, PC2)-plane provided a graphical overview of the GDB-17 chemical space. Rapid ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) of GDB-17 using the city-block distance CBD(MQN) as a similarity search measure was enabled by a hashed MQN-fingerprint. LBVS of the entire GDB-17 and of selected subsets identified shape similar, scaffold hopping analogs (ROCS > 1.6 and T(SF) < 0.5) of 15 drugs. Over 97% of these analogs occurred within CBD(MQN) ≤ 12 from each drug, a constraint which might help focus advanced virtual screening.

The deadlock problem becomes further complicated when the underlying system is distributed and when tasks have timing constraints. Deadlock detection and optimization is very difficult in a distributed database system because no controller has complete and current information about the system and data dependencies. The deadlock problem is intrinsic to a distributed database system which employs locking as its concurrency control algorithm. In this paper, an optimization technique for the detected deadlock is presented which minimizes the abortion of the selected victim transactions. The optimization technique is concerned with the detection of the transactions which are the basis for the most of the deadlock cycles (either local or global) in the system. The presented technique aborts the transaction’s requests which are really to blame for the formation of many deadlock cycles.

One of the major sources of information is databases. Databases and database technology are having major impact on the growing use of computers. Almost all IT applications are storing and retrieving information from databases. Retrieving information database requires knowledge of database languages like SQL. The Structured Query Language (SQL) norms are been pursued in almost all languages for relational database systems. However, not everybody is able to write SQL queries as they may not be aware of the structure of the database. So this has led to the development of Intelligent Database System ( IDBS) . There is an overwhelming need for non-expert users to query relational databases in their natural language instead of working with the values of the attributes. As a result many intelligent natural language interfaces to databases have been developed, which provides flexible options for manipulating queries. The idea of using Natural Language instead of SQL has prompted the development of new type of processing called Natural language Interface to Database. NLIDB is a step towards the development of intelligent database systems (IDBS) to enhance the users in performing flexible querying in databases. This paper is an introduction to Intelligent Database System and Natural Language Interface to Databases. Then a brief overview of NLIDB subcomponents is given and then discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures and various approaches for the development of NLIDB systems., DOI: , Keywords: database,databases,language,natural,information,sql,development,intelligent,nlidb,systems,major,almost,retrieving,languages,query,relational,queries,system,idbs,users, Title: Natural language Interface for Database: A Brief review, Year: 2011\n",

However, not everybody is able to write SQL queries as they may not be aware of the structure of the database. So this has led to the development of Intelligent Database System ( IDBS) . There is an overwhelming need for non-expert users to query relational databases in their natural language instead of working with the values of the attributes. As a result many intelligent natural language interfaces to databases have been developed, which provides flexible options for manipulating queries. The idea of using Natural Language instead of SQL has prompted the development of new type of processing called Natural language Interface to Database. NLIDB is a step towards the development of intelligent database systems (IDBS) to enhance the users in performing flexible querying in databases.

This can be measured in several ways, including the number of unique game states, the number of decision points, and the total number of legal actions over all decision points. These numbers are either known or estimated for a wide range of classic games such as chess and checkers. In the stochastic and imperfect information game of poker, these sizes are easily computed in \\limit\" games which restrict the players’ available actions, but until now had only been estimated for the more complicated \\no-limit\" variants.

Interoperation based on declarative queries to multiple network-accessible databases will support analyses and investigations that are orders of magnitude faster and more powerful than what can be accomplished through interactive navigation.

I then propose an architecture for query-based interoperation that includes a number of novel components of an information infrastructure for molecular biology. These components include a knowledge base that describes relationships among the conceptualizations used in different biological databases, a module that can determine the DBs that are relevant to a particular query, a module that can translate a query and its results from one conceptualization to another, a collection of DB drivers that provide uniform physical access to different database management systems, a suite of translators that can interconvert among different database schema languages, and a database that describes the network location and access methods for biological databases.

The method uses a repository of existing design solutions where designers can recognize and retrieve analogical inspirations. Yet, exploring for analogical inspiration has been a laborious task for designers. This work presents a computational methodology that is driven by a topic modeling technique called non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is widely used in the text mining field for its ability to discover topics within documents based on their semantic content. In the proposed methodology, NMF is performed iteratively to build hierarchical repositories of design solutions, with which designers can explore clusters of analogical stimuli. This methodology has been applied to a repository of mechanical design-related patents, processed to contain only component-, behavior-, or material-based content to test if unique and valuable attribute-based analogical inspiration can be discovered from the different representations of patent data. The hierarchical repositories have been visualized, and a case study has been conducted to test the effectiveness of the analogical retrieval process of the proposed methodology. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the exploration-based computational methodology may provide designers an enhanced control over design repositories to retrieve analogical inspiration for DbA practice., DOI: 10.1115/1.4043364, Keywords: analogical,methodology,design,designers,solutions,inspiration,nmf,repositories,dba,method,repository,retrieve,computational,content,proposed,hierarchical,test,important,innovation,gained, Title: Design-by-Analogy: Exploring for Analogical Inspiration With Behavior, Material, and Component-Based Structural Representation of Patent Databases, Year: 2019\n",

The Apache Unstructured Information Management applications (UIMA) framework is used in several projects, tools and resources, and has become a de facto standard in this area. Despite the multiple use of UIMA as a document-based schema, it does not provide native database support. In order to facilitate distributed storage and enable UIMA-based projects to perform targeted queries, we have developed the UIMA Database Interface (UIMA DI). UIMA DI sets up an environment for a generic use of UIMA documents in database systems. In addition, the integration of UIMA DI into rights and resource management tools enables user and group-speciﬁc access to UIMA documents and provides data protection. Finally, UIMA documents can be made accessible for third party programs.

In this respect, MOS are widely used to validate objective quality prediction models. To facilitate comparison between models from different laboratories it is desirable to have publicly available image quality databases. Several databases were made available in recent years. In this paper, we introduce the Wireless Imaging Quality (WIQ) database which, unlike any of the previous databases, takes into account the complex nature of a wireless communications link. The database is thus considered as a valuable complement to the existing databases. The distortion model, the test images, and two quality experiments that we conducted are explained in this paper. A number of contemporary objective quality metrics are tested for their quality prediction performance on the database.

We report in this paper on our recent effort to create a publicly available database of the first three VTR frequency trajectories. The database contains a representative subset of the TEMIT corpus with respect to speaker, gender, dialect and phonetic context, with a total of 538 sentences. A Matlab-based labeling tool is developed, with high-resolution wideband spectrograms displayed to assist in visual identification of VTR frequency values which are then recorded via mouse clicks and local spline interpolation. Special attention is paid to VTR values during consonant-to-vowel (CV) and vowel-to-consonant (VC) transitions, and to speech segments with vocal tract anti-resonances. Using this database, we quantitatively assess two common automatic VTR tracking techniques in terms of their average tracking errors analyzed within each of the six major broad phonetic classes as well as during CV and VC transitions.

This transformation maps image structures onto code trees of different height, depending on the size of the structure. Thereby, important structures are effectively separated from the background.

The algorithms are domain independent and were successfully used for workpiece recognition and for traffic sign detection.

The implementation is done on a 9-node transputer image processing system.

In IoT, large numbers of sensors are used in daily lives. These sensors generate a huge amount of heterogeneous data that needs to be handled by the appropriate DBMS. The IoT has a challenge for the DBMS in evaluating how to store and manipulate a huge amount of heterogeneous data. DBMS can be categorized into two main types: The Relational DBMSs and the Non-relational DBMSs. This paper aims to provide a thorough comparative evaluation of two popular open-source DBMSs: MySQL as a Relational DBMS and MongoDB as a Non-relational DBMS. This comparison is based on evaluating the performance of inserting and retrieving a huge amount of IoT data and evaluating the performance of the two types of databases to work on resources with different specifications in cloud computing. This paper also proposes two prediction models and differentiates between them to estimate the response time in terms of the size of the database and the specifications of the cloud instance. These models help to select the appropriate DBMS to manage and store a certain size of data on an instance with particular specifications based on the estimated response time. The results indicate that MongoDB outperforms MySQL in terms of latency and the database size through increasing the amount of tested data. Moreover, MongoDB can save resources better than MySQL that needs resources with high capabilities to work with less performance., DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3002164, Keywords: dbms,data,iot,amount,two,database,huge,evaluating,dbmss,mysql,mongodb,performance,resources,specifications,size,challenge,sensors,heterogeneous,needs,appropriate, Title: Performance Evaluation of IoT Data Management Using MongoDB Versus MySQL Databases in Different Cloud Environments, Year: 2020\n",

      "Paper Title: EEG Databases in Research and Clinical Practice: Current Status and Future Directions, Paper Abstract: The influence of genetics and the environment, identibing reliable pre-morbid markers, expanding syndrome profiles, building quantitative models of brain function: the current interest in databases is motivated by such scientific imperatives. It is also fueled by the improved availability of the necessary technology, and by a number of high-profile initiatives. In particular, the Human Brain Project has seeded a plethora of distributed databases across scale and species, helped develop the field of Neuroinformatics, and provided a major impetus to the development of the analytical, biocomputational modeling, simulation tools and the interoperability that will link a federation of databases to enhance hypothesis-driven, as well as discovery-driven, neuroscience (see Koslow article in this issue). A number of journals have now begun to mandate that authors of accepted papers will provide access by other scientists to the raw data upon which the report was based (for example, Van Horn et al., 2004'). There is also the emergence of a standardized international database, generated using standardized methodology in all contributing laboratories and where the data analysis is centralized (see Gordon et al. article in this issue). This development allows for the study of individual differences, multi-modal interrelationships and the specificity, or generalizability, of the findings to be examined. The increased scale of database development is also coupled to a growing demand for large-scale science. The importance of \"large-scale science\" is highlighted in a recent article by five NIH directors in Nature Neuroscience entitled: \"Limits to growth: why neuroscience needs largescale science\" (Insel et al., 20042). In this Special Issue, invited authors not only discuss the issues generally, but also showcase several ambitious databases and innovative ways to exploit them. The Australian EEG Database paper (Hunter et al ) outlines the potential outcomes from a web-based de-identified searchable database of 18,500 EEG records across a spectrum of clinical disorders. Prichep's contribution proposes methods to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of qEEG in neurobehavioral clinical patient populations with the aim of eventually defining these disorders with objective qEEG based measures. Duffy extols the clinical utility of long latency ERPs, including Z statistic significance probability mapping and BESA analysis in order to understand patientspecific sensory processing difficulties, leading to more precise case conceptualization and better defined treatment. Johnstone et al. review clinical EEG studies in neurofeedback and propose treatment interventions that are testable in databases. Saletu et al. emphasize the \"key and lock\" principle as a potential pharmaco-EEG utility for defining therapeutic approaches as well as having significant potential for pharmacologically-based studies. This information is complemented by insights from Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Thatcher et al. examine the validity of LORETA in defining patterns of abnormal qEEG activity defined by reference to a normative EEG database. Blinowska and Durka highlight the progress in the biomedical sciences for data-sharing and new EEGiERP analyses, illustrated via their EEG portal. Databases provide enhanced statistical power from data pooling, and show promise of elucidating new patterns of interrelationships amongst data obtained from normal subjects. They will also ultimately be used in the discovery of new medical treatments and will have applications to \"Personalized Medicine,\" the study of individual subjects compared to their multi-dimensionally matched controls. We are entering a time in the history of Clinical Neuroscience (psychiatry, neurology, psychology) when we have sufficient data, as well as the availability of widely acceptable tools; so that the time is ripe to develop databased approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The active collaboration across disciplines and individual laboratories, together with support from granting agencies, may provide for the development of standard approved methods of investigation as well as clinical practice. Such developments will inexorably lead to the acceptance of qEEGbased methods and studies in training programs in all of the relevant disciplines. Microscopic reductionism will continue to be a major focus of neuroscience. However, databases of EEG and other high-level brain measures will provide a vital counterbalance by providing the foundation for a different kind\n",

      "Paper Title: Forecasting Stock Market Prices Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models: A Systematic Review, Performance Analysis and Discussion of Implications, Paper Abstract: The financial sector has greatly impacted the monetary well-being of consumers, traders, and financial institutions. In the current era, artificial intelligence is redefining the limits of the financial markets based on state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. There is extensive use of these techniques in financial instrument price prediction, market trend analysis, establishing investment opportunities, portfolio optimization, etc. Investors and traders are using machine learning and deep learning models for forecasting financial instrument movements. With the widespread adoption of AI in finance, it is imperative to summarize the recent machine learning and deep learning models, which motivated us to present this comprehensive review of the practical applications of machine learning in the financial industry. This article examines algorithms such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, ensemble algorithms, time series analysis algorithms, and deep learning algorithms for stock price prediction and solving classification problems. The contributions of this review article are as follows: (a) it provides a description of machine learning and deep learning models used in the financial sector; (b) it provides a generic framework for stock price prediction and classification; and (c) it implements an ensemble model—“Random Forest + XG-Boost + LSTM”—for forecasting TAINIWALCHM and AGROPHOS stock prices and performs a comparative analysis with popular machine learning and deep learning models.\n",

Using a database query tool or audit software, students query a database with tables for call details, invoices, invoice details, plan rates, and users on plan. The queries are representative of those that accountants could develop to analyze transaction‐level data to detect errors and develop insights about business operations. Query‐based approaches to analyzing transaction data can enable businesses to make sense of their operations and ensure that they and their trading partners comply with their mutual agreements. The case is appropriate for students with rudimentary database querying proficiency, e.g., at the level developed by Borthick et al.'s (2001) case on assuring compliance for responses to website referrals.

      "Paper Title: A Survey of Game Theoretic Approaches to Modelling Decision-Making in Information Warfare Scenarios, Paper Abstract: Our increasing dependence on information technologies and autonomous systems has escalated international concern for information- and cyber-security in the face of politically, socially and religiously motivated cyber-attacks. Information warfare tactics that interfere with the flow of information can challenge the survival of individuals and groups. It is increasingly important that both humans and machines can make decisions that ensure the trustworthiness of information, communication and autonomous systems. Subsequently, an important research direction is concerned with modelling decision-making processes. One approach to this involves modelling decision-making scenarios as games using game theory. This paper presents a survey of information warfare literature, with the purpose of identifying games that model different types of information warfare operations. Our contribution is a systematic identification and classification of information warfare games, as a basis for modelling decision-making by humans and machines in such scenarios. We also present a taxonomy of games that map to information warfare and cyber crime problems as a precursor to future research on decision-making in such scenarios. We identify and discuss open research questions including the role of behavioural game theory in modelling human decision making and the role of machine decision-making in information warfare scenarios.\n",

      "Paper Title: Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Stackelberg Games with State and Control Delays, Paper Abstract: In this article, we consider a linear-quadratic mean field game between a leader (dominating player) and a group of followers (agents) under the Stackelberg game setting as proposed in [A. Bensoussan, M. Chau, and S. Yam, Appl. Math. Optim., 74 (2016), pp. 91-128], so that the evolution of each individual follower is now also subjected to delay effects from both his/her state and control variables, as well as those of the leader. The overall Stackelberg game is solved by tackling three subproblems hierarchically. Their resolution corresponds to the establishment of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of three different forward-backward stochastic functional differential equations, which we manage by applying the unified continuation method as first developed in, for example, [Y.

      "Paper Title: Parallel Evaluation of Hierarchical Image Databases, Paper Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical image transformation and efficient parallel algorithms for its evaluation. This transformation maps image structures onto code trees of different height, depending on the size of the structure. Thereby, important structures are effectively separated from the background. The inherent parallelism of such a hierarchical image transformation is outlined. The algorithms are domain independent and were successfully used for workpiece recognition and for traffic sign detection. A communication module for farmer-worker applications that supports specialized processors, like frame grabbers or display units, as well as the parallel recognition process is illustrated in detail. The implementation is done on a 9-node transputer image processing system. The functionality from grabbing an image and low-level filtering to transformation and high-level symbolic pattern analysis is integrated. Runtimes for the analysis of traffic scenes of less than half a second were achieved. Illustrated examples and experimental results are discussed.\n",

      "Paper Title: Game creativity analysis using neural networks, Paper Abstract: Abstract Experts in ball games are characterized by extraordinary creative behaviour. This article outlines a framework for analysing types of individual development of creative performance based on neural networks. Therefore, two kinds of sport-specific training programme for the learning of game creativity in real field contexts were investigated. Two training groups (soccer, n = 20; field hockey, n = 17) but not a control group (n = 18) improved with respect to three measuring points (P < 0.001), although no difference could be established between the two training groups (P = 0.212). By using neural networks it is now possible to distinguish between five types of learning behaviour in the development of performance, the most striking ones being what we call “up-down” and “down-up”. In the field hockey group in particular, an up-down fluctuation process was identified, whereby creative performance increases initially, but at the end is worse than in the middle of the training programme. The reverse down-up fluctuation process was identified mainly in the soccer group. The results are discussed with regard to recent training explanation models, such as the super-compensation theory, with a view to further development of neural network applications.\n",

      "Paper Title: Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Improve Linux Process Scheduling, Paper Abstract: In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn the CPU time-slice utilization behavior of known programs in a Linux system. Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The \"Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis\" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior.\n",

The W3C RDB2RDF Working Group is in the process of ratifying two standards to map relational databases to RDF: Direct Mapping and R2RML mapping language. Through our experience as implementors of two RDB2RDF systems: Ultrawrap and Morph, and as authors of R2RML mappings, we have observed mappings that are reusable in order to solve a commonly occurring problem. In this paper, we have compiled these mappings and present a non-exhaustive list of RDB2RDF Mapping Patterns. We aspire that the mapping patterns in this paper are considered as a starting point for new mapping patterns.\n",

      "Paper Title: Testing Spatial Data Deliverance in SQL and NoSQL Database Using NodeJS Fullstack Web App, Paper Abstract: During the last decade, we saw an explosion of geospatial data being produced. Most of which coming from GPS-enabled devices available for general consumers. The large amount of geotagged data coined the term ‘Geospatial Big Data’, indicating the semi-structured and unstructured nature of such data. SQL relational databases have been known in the past to handle geospatial data very well. However, the abundance of geospatial big data pushed forward the need for NoSQL database which is expected to perform better in terms of handling and storing geospatial big data. This paper discusses the quantitative comparison of performance between the SQL (i.e., PostGIS) and NoSQL (i.e., MongoDB) databases in handling geospatial big data. A NodeJS-based angular-framework web app was developed to test the real-world performance of MongoDB and PostGIS in handling a large amount of simulated geospatial data. A different number of points were generated for testing the geospatial data storing and loading capability of both the databases. The test was conducted by comparing the result of XHR (XML HTTP Request) of both databases in each case. The result showed that NoSQL database, i.e. MongoDB, performs better in loading big geospatial data compared to traditional SQL database using PostGIS.\n",

STREETS moves beyond counterterrorism and represents the first use of Stackelberg games for traffic patrolling, in the process providing a novel algorithm for solving such games that addresses three major challenges in modeling and scale-up. First, there exists a high degree of unpredictability in travel times through road networks, which we capture using a Markov Decision Process for planning the patrols of the defender (the police) in the game. Second, modeling all possible police patrols and their interactions with a large number of adversaries (drivers) introduces a significant scalability challenge. To address this challenge we apply a compact game representation in a novel fashion combined with adversary and state sampling. Third, patrol strategies must balance exploitation (minimizing violations) with exploration (maximizing omnipresence), a tradeoff we model by solving a biobjective optimization problem. We present experimental results using real-world traffic data from Singapore. This work is done in collaboration with the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs and is currently being evaluated by the Singapore Police Force.\n",

      "Paper Title: Is This a Game or a Learning Moment, Paper Abstract: Examinations often serve as the primary means to assess student learning within a classroom environment. To increase the probability of success in examinations, many instructors will employ a review session to prepare their students. The type of review session may vary from a laundry list of potential test topics to mock examinations. In order to provide the clarity that a student needs, instructors must structure their review session to enable their students to not only understand the material, but also be able to apply the material to new situations that they may encounter on the examination and even beyond the classroom. One interesting way that we used to review material that provided insight and interaction and even injected some fun into learning was by using a variation of the “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ” television game show to conduct midterm and final review sessions in both undergraduate and MBA operations management courses. The Web site http://condor.depaul.edu/∼greinhar/ wwtbam.html contains the complete set of downloadable files necessary to conduct the review session (shown in Table 1).\n",

To resolve this problem, an optimization method of security configuration based on game theory is proposed. Firstly, a security configuration model based on non-cooperative game is built which in- fers the optimal strategy of systems and users respectively by calculating their strategies and incentives. Secondly, to optimize security configuration further, it cooperatively optimizes the individual optimal strategy by cooperative game, thus eliminating the cases that individual optimal is not the overall optimal. An illustrated experiment shows that this method can coordinate the security of network systems and usability of users so that the security configu- ration of system is optimized magnificently.\n",

This article presents the development of a model for assessing the quality of educational games for teaching software engineering. The model has been systematically derived from literature and evaluated in terms of its applicability, usefulness, validity and reliability through a series of case studies, applying educational board games in software engineering courses. Early results indicate that the model can be used to assess the aspects of motivation, user experience and learning of educational SE games.\n",

Would the physical education learning experience be different if physical educators designed and enacted sport teaching by attempting to accommodate the learning needs and preferences of the wrap around technology generation by giving deliberate attention to the design principles employed in digital game design? This article emerged from those two questions to highlight how, as games governed by rules of play, sport and digital game play have much in common and, therefore, sport teachers in physical education may enhance student engagement by incorporating learning principles used in digital game design.\n",

The methodology is oriented to developing problem-solving skills in science classes for 8 th graders, by including pre-classroom activities with the teacher, classroom activities, and a central activity using an interactive game for a mobile device. The core problem they had to solve through the game consisted in preserving and evolving different biological species from the animal kingdom, in an unknown and varying environment, by modifying some key factors for evolution of the species. The study was implemented in two main stages: a guided visit to a zoo observing animals directly, and a simulation game that takes place in the school during four weeks. Results show highly motivated learners with a fast adoption of mobile devices, fully engaged in a learning task without external control.\n",

      "Paper Title: MarioQA: Answering Questions by Watching Gameplay Videos, Paper Abstract: We present a framework to analyze various aspects of models for video question answering (VideoQA) using customizable synthetic datasets, which are constructed automatically from gameplay videos. Our work is motivated by the fact that existing models are often tested only on datasets that require excessively high-level reasoning or mostly contain instances accessible through single frame inferences. Hence, it is difficult to measure capacity and flexibility of trained models, and existing techniques often rely on adhoc implementations of deep neural networks without clear insight into datasets and models. We are particularly interested in understanding temporal relationships between video events to solve VideoQA problems; this is because reasoning temporal dependency is one of the most distinct components in videos from images. To address this objective, we automatically generate a customized synthetic VideoQA dataset using Super Mario Bros. gameplay videos so that it contains events with different levels of reasoning complexity. Using the dataset, we show that properly constructed datasets with events in various complexity levels are critical to learn effective models and improve overall performance.\n",

I briefly describe the application of stochastic learning automata to game and team problems and then present an adaptive element that is a synthesis of aspects of stochastic learning automata and typical neuron‐like adaptive elements. These elements act as self‐interested agents that work toward improving their performance with respect to their individual preference orderings. Networks of these elements can solve a variety of team decision problems, some of which take the form of layered networks in which the ‘‘hidden units’’ become appropriate functional components as they attempt to improve their own payoffs.\n",

To evaluate our system, we developed three game applications-a first-person-shooter game (for VR and AR environments, respectively) and a sword game (for the AR environment). Our immersive system provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the VR or AR world by physically moving around the real world and aiming freely with tangible objects. This encourages physical interaction between players as they compete or collaborate with other players. Evaluation of our system consists of users' subjective opinions and their objective performances. Our design principles and evaluation results can be applied to similar immersive game applications based on AR/VR.\n",

This paper presents the results of a study that attempts to quantify the effectiveness of computer games as programming projects over non-games. Students completed five major programming assignments during the semester in an introductory programming course. For each assignment, students were given an option between two programming projects, a game and a non-game. Throughout the term, 78.9% of the assignments submitted by students were the game option. The average grade, however, on game assignments was 89.1%, while the non-game average was 95.1%. In a post-term survey 84% of student respondents answered \"yes\" to the question, \"Did the games provide any extra motivation for you to complete the projects with a high level of quality?\" Results suggest that games do indeed provide psychological motivation and increase course enjoyment, even though they may not improve students' scores\n",

The proposed iShare framework leverages the Blockchain concept used in Bitcoin systems where multiple organizations/agencies participate for information sharing (without violating their privacy) to secure and monitor their cyberspace. Note that the Bitcoin for financial transactions has already demonstrated that there is a trusted, auditable sharing with peer-to-peer communications accompanied by a public ledger. The main aim of the Blockchain-based iShare framework is to constantly collect high-resolution, cyber-attack information across organizational boundaries of which the organizations have no specific knowledge or control over any other organizations’ data or damage caused by cyber-attacks. In the proposed iShare framework, the decentralized nature of the Blockchain and digitally signed transactions ensure that an adversary cannot pose as a legitimate organization/user or cannot control/hamper the system because of the digital-signatures and cannot learn anything from the public ledger that has just hashed pointers. Moreover, we analyze the security attacks by outsiders (not participating in the iShare) using a Stackelberg game.\n",

      "Paper Title: Design-by-Analogy: Exploring for Analogical Inspiration With Behavior, Material, and Component-Based Structural Representation of Patent Databases, Paper Abstract: Design-by-analogy (DbA) is an important method for innovation that has gained much attention due to its history of leading to successful and novel design solutions. The method uses a repository of existing design solutions where designers can recognize and retrieve analogical inspirations. Yet, exploring for analogical inspiration has been a laborious task for designers. This work presents a computational methodology that is driven by a topic modeling technique called non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is widely used in the text mining field for its ability to discover topics within documents based on their semantic content. In the proposed methodology, NMF is performed iteratively to build hierarchical repositories of design solutions, with which designers can explore clusters of analogical stimuli. This methodology has been applied to a repository of mechanical design-related patents, processed to contain only component-, behavior-, or material-based content to test if unique and valuable attribute-based analogical inspiration can be discovered from the different representations of patent data. The hierarchical repositories have been visualized, and a case study has been conducted to test the effectiveness of the analogical retrieval process of the proposed methodology. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the exploration-based computational methodology may provide designers an enhanced control over design repositories to retrieve analogical inspiration for DbA practice.\n",

The deadlock problem becomes further complicated when the underlying system is distributed and when tasks have timing constraints. Deadlock detection and optimization is very difficult in a distributed database system because no controller has complete and current information about the system and data dependencies. The deadlock problem is intrinsic to a distributed database system which employs locking as its concurrency control algorithm. In this paper, an optimization technique for the detected deadlock is presented which minimizes the abortion of the selected victim transactions. The optimization technique is concerned with the detection of the transactions which are the basis for the most of the deadlock cycles (either local or global) in the system. The presented technique aborts the transaction’s requests which are really to blame for the formation of many deadlock cycles. Also the presented deadlock detection algorithm does not detect any false deadlock or exclude any really existing deadlocks. In this technique global deadlock is not dependent on the local deadlock system\n",

Our system uses a dual Doppler radar mounted onto a restroom ceiling and wall. Machine learning methods, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, support vector machine, and random forest methods, are applied to the Doppler radar data to verify the model’s efficiency and features. Experimental results from 21 participants demonstrated the accurate classification of eight realistic behaviors, including falling. Using the Doppler spectrograms (time–velocity distribution) as the inputs, CNN showed the best results with an overall classification accuracy of 95.6% and 100% fall classification accuracy. We confirmed that these accuracies were better than those achieved by conventional restroom monitoring techniques using thermal sensors and radars. Furthermore, the comparison results of various machine learning methods and cases using each radar’s data show that the higher-order derivative parameters of acceleration and jerk, and the motion information in the horizontal direction are the efficient features for behavior classification in a restroom. These findings indicate that daily restroom monitoring using the proposed radar system accurately recognizes human behaviors and allows early detection of fall accidents.\n",

This paper introduces a real-time decentralized approach, in which decentralization strategy reduces computational complexity in multi-pursuer multievader situations, cooperative chasing strategy guarantees capture of some superior evaders, and min-max double-sided jamming confrontation provides optimal jamming-estimation strategies under adversarial noisy environments.

We found that the binary scheme performed the best, but gesture-based control schemes are stimulating and appealing. Results also suggest that the deformation gestures are best mapped to simple and natural tasks. In study two, we tested continuous gestures in a 3D racing game using the same control scheme categorization. Results were mostly consistent with study one but showed an improvement in performance and preference for the action control scheme.\n",

Bardo Composer uses a speech recognition system to translate player speech into text, which is classified according to a model of emotion. Bardo Composer then uses Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search, a variant of Stochastic Beam Search that we introduce in this paper, with a neural model to generate musical pieces conveying the desired emotion. We performed a user study with 116 participants to evaluate whether people are able to correctly identify the emotion conveyed in the pieces generated by the system. In our study we used pieces generated for Call of the Wild, a Dungeons and Dragons campaign available on YouTube. Our results show that human subjects could correctly identify the emotion of the generated music pieces as accurately as they were able to identify the emotion of pieces written by humans.\n",

      "Paper Title: Strategy Grafting in Extensive Games, Paper Abstract: Extensive games are often used to model the interactions of multiple agents within an environment. Much recent work has focused on increasing the size of an extensive game that can be feasibly solved. Despite these improvements, many interesting games are still too large for such techniques. A common approach for computing strategies in these large games is to first employ an abstraction technique to reduce the original game to an abstract game that is of a manageable size. This abstract game is then solved and the resulting strategy is played in the original game. Most top programs in recent AAAI Computer Poker Competitions use this approach. The trend in this competition has been that strategies found in larger abstract games tend to beat strategies found in smaller abstract games. These larger abstract games have more expressive strategy spaces and therefore contain better strategies. In this paper we present a new method for computing strategies in large games. This method allows us to compute more expressive strategies without increasing the size of abstract games that we are required to solve. We demonstrate the power of the approach experimentally in both small and large games, while also providing a theoretical justification for the resulting improvement.\n",

      "Paper Title: Visualization and Virtual Screening of the Chemical Universe Database GDB-17, Paper Abstract: The chemical universe database GDB-17 contains 166.4 billion molecules of up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens obeying rules for chemical stability, synthetic feasibility, and medicinal chemistry. GDB-17 was analyzed using 42 integer value descriptors of molecular structure which we term \"Molecular Quantum Numbers\" (MQN). Principal component analysis and representation of the (PC1, PC2)-plane provided a graphical overview of the GDB-17 chemical space. Rapid ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) of GDB-17 using the city-block distance CBD(MQN) as a similarity search measure was enabled by a hashed MQN-fingerprint. LBVS of the entire GDB-17 and of selected subsets identified shape similar, scaffold hopping analogs (ROCS > 1.6 and T(SF) < 0.5) of 15 drugs. Over 97% of these analogs occurred within CBD(MQN) ≤ 12 from each drug, a constraint which might help focus advanced virtual screening. An MQN-searchable 50 million subset of GDB-17 is publicly available at www.gdb.unibe.ch .\n",

      "Paper Title: Collaborate and Share: An Experimental Study of the Effects of Task and Reward Interdependencies in Online Games, Paper Abstract: Today millions of players interact with one another in online games, especially massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). These games promote interaction among players by offering interdependency features, but to date few studies have asked what interdependency design factors of MMORPGs make them fun for players, produce experiences of flow, or enhance player performance. In this study, we focused on two game design features: task and reward interdependency. We conducted a controlled experiment that compared the interaction effects of low and high task-interdependency conditions and low and high reward-interdependency conditions on three dependent variables: fun, flow, and performance. We found that in a low task-interdependency condition, players had more fun, experienced higher levels of flow, and perceived better performance when a low reward-interdependency condition also obtained. In contrast, in a high task-interdependency condition, all of these measures were higher when a high reward-interdependency condition also obtained.\n",

      "Paper Title: Game Design Patterns for Collaborative Player Interactions, Paper Abstract: Collaborative (or cooperative) games became very popular over the recent years. Aside from being received well by players, great collaborative games also offer the potential to train their players’ ability to work in teams. However, some other games include additional players without adapting their design appropriately, which may lead to games where the players hardly interact with each other and with little to none benefit when another player is present. This paper aims to improve this situation by introducing game design patterns for collaborative player interactions. Being extracted from well-received games, these patterns can be used as guidance for collaborative game designs fostering interaction between players. The interactions are classified along several dimensions (e.g. spatial and temporal) and can therefore be easily selected for specific situations. An example game design where some of these patterns were applied is also described.\n",

Furthermore, humans share information about intentions and future actions using eye gaze. Among primates, humans are unique in the whiteness of the sclera and amount of sclera shown, essential for communication via interpretation of eye gaze. This paper extends our previous work in a game-like interactive task by the use of computerised recognition of eye gaze and fuzzy signature-based interpretation of possible intentions. This extends our notion of robot instinctive behaviour to intentional behaviour.We show a good improvement of speed of response in a simple use of eye gaze information.We also show a significant and more sophisticated use of the eye gaze information, which eliminates the need for control actions on the user's part. We also make a suggestion as to returning visibility of control to the user in these cases.\n",

      "Paper Title: Coordination in CIM:Bringing Database Functionality to Application Systems, Paper Abstract: 1-56555-147-8 c © 1998 Simulation Councils, Inc. Coordination in CIM means enforcing dependencies between autonomous application subsystems. We propose an architecture that generalizes multidatabase technology and consists of a global coordinator and local specialized agents, one for each subsystem to be coordinated. The agent associated to a subsystem not only monitors relevant subsystem activity but also guarantees certain properties of operations executed in a subsystem. Therefore, it has to provide database functionality for subsystems even in cases they do not rest upon databases. The coordination itself is a synthesis of (advanced) transaction models and workflows. Aside from an introduction to the transactional coordination model, we concentrate in this paper on the analysis of different classes of subsystems and elaborate on properties required from the subsystem and its agent to ensure execution guarantees. Furthermore, we examine to which degree database functionality can be provided for application systems with a given set of properties. Our examples are taken from an industrial project in the area of computer integrated manufacturing. ∗This work has been partially supported by the Swiss Commission of Technology and Innovation (KTI) under contract number 3008.2 †Present address: Credit Suisse, Advanced Technologies, Postfach 100, CH–8070 Zurich\n",

      "Paper Title: A Strategy for Database Interoperation, Paper Abstract: To realize the full potential of biological databases (DBs) requires more than the interactive, hypertext flavor of database interoperation that is now so popular in the bioinformatics community. Interoperation based on declarative queries to multiple network-accessible databases will support analyses and investigations that are orders of magnitude faster and more powerful than what can be accomplished through interactive navigation. I present a vision of the capabilities that a query-based interoperation infrastructure should provide, and identify assumptions underlying, and requirements of, this vision. I then propose an architecture for query-based interoperation that includes a number of novel components of an information infrastructure for molecular biology. These components include a knowledge base that describes relationships among the conceptualizations used in different biological databases, a module that can determine the DBs that are relevant to a particular query, a module that can translate a query and its results from one conceptualization to another, a collection of DB drivers that provide uniform physical access to different database management systems, a suite of translators that can interconvert among different database schema languages, and a database that describes the network location and access methods for biological databases. A number of the components are translators that bridge the heterogeneities that exist between biological DBs at several different levels, including the conceptual level, the data model, the query language, and data formats.\n",

This is the domain of affective computing. In our work we focus on the applications of affective techniques in the design of video games. We assume that a change in the affective condition of a player can be detected based on the monitoring of physiological signals following the James-Lange theory of emotions. We propose the use of game design patterns introduced by Björk and Holopainen to build games. We identify a set of patterns that can be considered affective. Then we demonstrate how these patterns can be used in a design of a scroll-runner game. We address the problem of the calibration of measurements in order to reﬂect responses of individual users. We also provide results of practical experiments to verify our approach.\n",

      "Paper Title: Computer Game Use and Television Viewing Increased Risk for Overweight among Low Activity Girls: Fourth Thai National Health Examination Survey 2008-2009, Paper Abstract: Studies of the relationship between sedentary behaviors and overweight among children and adolescents show mixed results. The fourth Thai National Health Examination Survey data collected between 2008 and 2009 were used to explore this association in 5,999 children aged 6 to 14 years. The prevalence of overweight defined by the age- and gender-specific body mass index cut-points of the International Obesity Task Force was 16%. Using multiple logistic regression, computer game use for more than 1 hour a day was found to be associated with an increased risk of overweight (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.93). The effect of computer game use and TV viewing on the risk for overweight was significantly pronounced among girls who spent ≤3 days/week in 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (AOR = 1.99 and 1.72, resp.). On the contrary, these sedentary behaviors did not exert significant risk for overweight among boys. The moderating effect on risk of overweight by physical inactivity and media use should be taken into consideration in designing the interventions for overweight control in children and adolescents. Tracking societal changes is essential for identification of potential areas for targeted interventions.\n",

We prove that a game has a potential function if and only if its payoff functions coincide with the Shapley value of a particular class of cooperative games indexed by the set of strategy profiles. Also a potential function of a noncooperative potential game coincides with the potentials (cf. Hart and Mas-Colell, 1989, Econometrica57, 589–614) of cooperative games indexed by the strategy set.

Management of database (BigData, so nomenclature) has become the global challenge. The data collection is currently managed and exploited mostly by using conventional data management tools such as classic relational database management systems (RDBMS) or conventional search engines. These systems and tools have been observed to be inefficient and incapable to handle the data in most of the cases e.g.: social networking sites. Efforts are being made to come up with some utility support in order to overcome the observed limitations. The research study was conducted to develop a Cloud-based Utility. It was aimed to convert structural database, SQL to un-structural database, NoSQL [11] systematically and sufficiently. The outcome of the study revealed that the database management becomes considerably scalable, flexible and efficient when traditional RDBMS are complimented by specifically designed rich set of alternative DBMS such as NoSQL, NewSQL based systems. The database conversion shall help in Database analysis and migration from traditional database to today’s BigData.\n",

      "Paper Title: Player Goal Recognition in Open-World Digital Games with Long Short-Term Memory Networks, Paper Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest in player modeling for digital games. Goal recognition, which aims to accurately recognize players' goals from observations of low-level player actions, is a key problem in player modeling. However, player goal recognition poses significant challenges because of the inherent complexity and uncertainty pervading gameplay. In this paper, we formulate player goal recognition as a sequence labeling task and introduce a goal recognition framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Results show that LSTM-based goal recognition is significantly more accurate than previous state-of-the-art methods, including n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks pre-trained with stacked denoising autoencoders, as well as Markov logic network-based models. Because of increased goal recognition accuracy and the elimination of labor-intensive feature engineering, LSTM-based goal recognition provides an effective solution to a central problem in player modeling for open-world digital games.\n",

In this respect, MOS are widely used to validate objective quality prediction models. To facilitate comparison between models from different laboratories it is desirable to have publicly available image quality databases. Several databases were made available in recent years. In this paper, we introduce the Wireless Imaging Quality (WIQ) database which, unlike any of the previous databases, takes into account the complex nature of a wireless communications link. The database is thus considered as a valuable complement to the existing databases. The distortion model, the test images, and two quality experiments that we conducted are explained in this paper. A number of contemporary objective quality metrics are tested for their quality prediction performance on the database. The WIQ database including test images and MOS is made freely available to the research community.\n",

      "Paper Title: Database Encryption - How to Balance Security with Performance, Paper Abstract: Encryption can provide strong security for data at rest, but developing a database encryption strategy must take many factors into consideration. Organizations must balance between the requirement for security and the desire for excellent performance. Encryption at the database level, versus application level and file level has proved to be the ideal method to protect sensitive data and deliver performance. There are a multitude of architectures and techniques to improve performance: the alternatives fall into two broad categories - alternative topologies to decrease encryption overhead and techniques to limit the number of encryption operations. In addition, performance and security, in real-world scenarios, are complex issues and experts should be used who understand all available options and the impact for each particular customer environment. Every organization must protect sensitive data or suffer potential legislative, regulatory, legal and brand consequences. Relying on perimeter security and database access control does not provide adequate security. Packaged database encryption solutions have proven to be the best alternative to protect sensitive data. This is a specialized and complex solution area and if internal resources don't have the cryptography expertise in relation to IT environment, outside expertise should be used to ensure superior performance. This paper reviews the performance aspects of three dominant topologies for database encryption.\n",

      "Paper Title: Predicting Cyber Risks through National Vulnerability Database, Paper Abstract: ABSTRACT Software vulnerabilities are the major cause of cyber security problems. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a public data source that maintains standardized information about reported software vulnerabilities. Since its inception in 1997, NVD has published information about more than 43,000 software vulnerabilities affecting more than 17,000 software applications. This information is potentially valuable in understanding trends and patterns in software vulnerabilities so that one can better manage the security of computer systems that are pestered by the ubiquitous software security flaws. In particular, one would like to be able to predict the likelihood that a piece of software contains a yet-to-be-discovered vulnerability, which must be taken into account in security management due to the increasing trend in zero-day attacks. We conducted an empirical study on applying data-mining techniques on NVD data with the objective of predicting the time to next vulnerability for a given software application. We experimented with various features constructed using the information available in NVD and applied various machine learning algorithms to examine the predictive power of the data. Our results show that the data in NVD generally have poor prediction capability, with the exception of a few vendors and software applications. We suggest possible reasons for why the NVD data have not produced a reasonable prediction model for time to next vulnerability with our current approach, and suggest alternative ways in which the data in NVD can be used for the purpose of risk estimation.\n",

This paper describes the contents, methodology and use of the public online COMETS (Connecting Outcome Measures in Entrepreneurship Technology and Science) database spanning all sciences, technologies, and high-tech industries; its parent COMETSandSTARS database which adds more data at organization and individual scientist-inventor-entrepreneur level restricted by vendor licenses to onsite use at NBER and/or UCLA; and their prototype Nanobank covering only nano-scale sciences and technologies. Some or all of these databases include or will include: US patents (granted and applications); NIH, NSF, SBIR, STTR Grants; Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge; ISI Highly Cited; US doctoral dissertations; IPEDS/HEGIS universities; all firms and other organizations which ever publish in ISI listed journals beginning in 1981, are assigned US patents (from 1975), or are listed on a covered grant; additional nanotechnology firms based on web search. Ticker/CUSIP codes enable linking public firms to the major databases covering them. A major matching/disambiguation effort assigns unique identifiers for an organization or individual so that their appearances are linked within and across the constituent legacy databases. Extensive geographic coding enables analysis at country, region, state, county, or city levels. The databases provide very flexible sources of data for serious research on many issues in the study of organizations in innovation systems in the development and spread of knowledge, and the economics of science. Enabling the study of these topics, among others, COMETS contributes substantially to the science of science and technology.\n",

Keeping the strategic form of the stage game fixed, we examine the behavior of subjects when information about past actions is perfect (perfect monitoring), noisy but public (public monitoring), and noisy and private (private monitoring). We find that the subjects sustain cooperation in every treatment, but that their strategies differ across the three treatments. Specifically, the strategies under imperfect monitoring are both more complex and more lenient than those under perfect monitoring. The results show how the changes in strategies across monitoring structures mitigate the effect of noise in monitoring on efficiency. (JEL C72, C73, C92, D82, D83)\n",

The attention mechanism of the model focuses on emotion-related elements of the IS09 and mel spectrogram feature and the emotion-related duration from the time of the feature. Thus, the model extracts emotion information from a given speech signal. The proposed model for the baseline study achieved a weighted accuracy (WA) of 68% for the improvised dataset of IEMOCAP. However, the WA of the proposed model of the main study and modified models could not achieve more than 68% in the improvised dataset. This is because of the reliability limit of the IEMOCAP dataset. A more reliable dataset is required for a more accurate evaluation of the model’s performance. Therefore, in this study, we reconstructed a more reliable dataset based on the labeling results provided by IEMOCAP. The experimental results of the model for the more reliable dataset confirmed a WA of 73%.\n",

In these websites, reputation systems, a proved useful mechanism, is introduced to help people to decide which information deserved to trust. To maintain the overall credibility of the information, users are confronted with assessing the reliability of information from different sources. This paper presents anti-collusion algorithm, a collusive group recognition method based on game theory. In reputation systems, users forming collusive group tend to increase theirs own reputations by abusing evaluation of other users' behaviors. Anti-collusion algorithm makes a good use of the game between the members of collusive group, who have to form a special pattern of profit distribution not only on income of reputation but also on distribution of profit if they want to get the benefits from collusion. In order to promote capabilities of the system, anti-collusion algorithm will be adopted to distinguish these groups in terms of the special pattern.\n",

The Burkholderia Genome Database represents a model for such a database, providing a powerful, user-friendly search and comparative analysis interface that contains features not found in other genome databases. It contains continually updated, curated and tracked information about Burkholderia cepacia complex genome annotations, plus other Burkholderia species genomes for comparison, providing a high-quality resource for its targeted cystic fibrosis research community.

In PRUW, a user privately reads a submodel from a system of N databases containing M submodels, updates it locally, and writes the update back to the databases without revealing the submodel index or the value of the update. The databases considered in this problem are only allowed to store a given amount of information specified by an arbitrary storage constraint. We provide a storage mechanism that determines the contents of each database prior to the application of the PRUW scheme, such that the total communication cost is minimized. We show that the proposed storage scheme achieves a lower total cost compared to what is achieved by using coded storage or divided storage to meet the given storage constraint.\n",

      "Paper Title: Bounds on the Price of stability of Undirected Network Design Games with Three Players, Paper Abstract: After almost seven years from its definition,2 the price of stability of undirected network design games with fair cost allocation remains to be elusive. Its exact characterization has been achieved only for the basic case of two players2,7 and, as soon as the number of players increases, the gap between the known upper and lower bounds becomes super-constant, even in the special variants of multicast and broadcast games. Motivated by the intrinsic difficulties that seem to characterize this problem, we analyze the already challenging case of three players and provide either new or improved bounds. For broadcast games, we prove an upper bound of 1.485 which exactly matches a lower bound given in Ref. 4; for multicast games, we show new upper and lower bounds which confine the price of stability in the interval [1.524; 1.532]; while, for the general case, we give an improved upper bound of 1.634. The techniques exploited in this paper are a refinement of those used in Ref. 7 and can be easily adapted to deal with all the cases involving a small number of players.\n",

It indicates that people have been searching for a harmonic balance between deterministic and stochastic aspects when playing games, which in this study, called the noble uncertainty. Currently, this study conjectured that noble uncertainty can be found at GR ∈ [0.07, 0.08] where evolutionary changes of both Mahjong and Chess have converged to it.\n",

      "Paper Title: Evolving Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Infectious Diseases Testing, Paper Abstract: Abstract Background Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to transform infectious disease testing. Uniquely, infectious disease testing is technologically diverse spaces in laboratory medicine, where multiple platforms and approaches may be required to support clinical decision-making. Despite advances in laboratory informatics, the vast array of infectious disease data is constrained by human analytical limitations. Machine learning can exploit multiple data streams, including but not limited to laboratory information and overcome human limitations to provide physicians with predictive and actionable results. As a quickly evolving area of computer science, laboratory professionals should become aware of AI/ML applications for infectious disease testing as more platforms are become commercially available. Content In this review we: (a) define both AI/ML, (b) provide an overview of common ML approaches used in laboratory medicine, (c) describe the current AI/ML landscape as it relates infectious disease testing, and (d) discuss the future evolution AI/ML for infectious disease testing in both laboratory and point-of-care applications. Summary The review provides an important educational overview of AI/ML technique in the context of infectious disease testing. This includes supervised ML approaches, which are frequently used in laboratory medicine applications including infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, sepsis, hepatitis, malaria, meningitis, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis. We also apply the concept of “data fusion” describing the future of laboratory testing where multiple data streams are integrated by AI/ML to provide actionable clinical knowledge.\n",

The business data stored these database is very important to investigate company dishonest act in the view of the digital forensics. However, it is difficult to extract meaningful data without blueprints because the table inside the database has exceedingly complicated relation and the role of the table and field in the table was so ambiguous. If we don't obtain the database's database or even if we get, but don't understand relationship in the table and meaning of each field, we cannot obtain the significant evidences. Therefore, the investigator should confirm the contents of the database blueprints and check the relationship between the table and hidden table which unsigned blueprints. In this paper, we improve the DBRE (database reverse engineering) process and analyze the table relationship of database and data extraction method in the view of the digital forensics. Moreover we proposed the efficient tool which more easily acquires digital evidences from databases using table relationship and data extraction.\n",

      "Paper Title: A Cooperative Game Framework for QoS Guided Job Allocation Schemes in Grids, Paper Abstract: A grid differs from traditional high performance computing systems in the heterogeneity of the computing nodes as well as the communication links that connect the different nodes together. In grids there exist users and service providers. The service providers provide the service for jobs that the users generate. Typically the amount of jobs generated by all the users are more than any single provider can handle alone with any acceptable quality of service (QoS). As such, the service providers need to cooperate and allocate jobs among them so that each is providing an acceptable QoS to their customers. QoS is of particular concerns to service providers as it directly affects customers' satisfaction and loyalty. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic solution to the QoS sensitive, grid job allocation problem. We model the QoS based, grid job allocation problem as a cooperative game and present the structure of the Nash Bargaining Solution. The proposed algorithm is fair to all users and represents a Pareto optimal solution to the QoS objective. One advantage of our scheme is the relatively low overhead and robust performance against inaccuracies in performance prediction information.\n",

      "Paper Title: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Optimum Decision Fusion in the Presence of Byzantines, Paper Abstract: Optimum decision fusion in the presence of malicious nodes - often referred to as Byzantines - is hindered by the necessity of exactly knowing the statistical behavior of Byzantines. In this paper, we focus on a simple, yet widely adopted, setup in which a fusion center (FC) is asked to make a binary decision about a sequence of system states by relying on the possibly corrupted decisions provided by local nodes. We propose a game-theoretic framework, which permits to exploit the superior performance provided by optimum decision fusion, while limiting the amount of a priori knowledge required. We use numerical simulations to derive the optimum behavior of the FC and the Byzantines in a game-theoretic sense, and to evaluate the achievable performance at the equilibrium point of the game. We analyze several different setups, showing that in all cases, the proposed solution permits to improve the accuracy of data fusion. We also show that, in some cases, it is preferable for the Byzantines to minimize the mutual information between the status of the observed system and the reports submitted to the FC, rather than always flipping the decision made by the local nodes.\n",

Discussions of the theory and design principles guiding CSILE development have been provided elsewhere (Scardamalia & Bereiter, in press-a; Scardamalia, Bereiter, McLean, Swallow, & Woodruff, 1989). Here we want to focus on one major characteristic of CSILE, its student-generated communal database, and to discuss findings that relate to its uses and effects. The communal database is central to CSILE's design, but we believe it can play an important role in any educational software system intended to foster inquiry, intellectual discourse, and social construction of knowledge. There are a number of experiments in which classroom computers play an important role in students' knowledge-related interactions. Educational experiments reported in the 1980s were based on computer conferencing (Black, Levin, Mehan, & Quinn, 1983), electronic mail (Hiltz, 1988; Levin, Riel, Rowe, & Boruta, 1985; Riel, 1983; Sayers, 1989), interactive writing programs making use of dialog journals (Staton, Shuy, Peyton, & Reed, 1988), and letters (Heath & Branscombe, 1985).

Examples of such emerging application domains are: Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Multimedia Information Systems, CAD/CAM, Time-Series Analysis, Medical Information Sstems, On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP), and Data Mining. These applications pose diverse requirements with respect to the information and the operations that need to be supported. From the database perspective, new techniques and tools therefore need to be developed towards increased processing efficiency. This monograph explores the way spatial database management systems aim at supporting queries that involve the space characteristics of the underlying data, and discusses query processing techniques for nearest neighbor queries. It provides both basic concepts and state-of-the-art results in spatial databases and parallel processing research, and studies numerous applications of nearest neighbor queries.\n",

Based on the findings from a longitudinal, two-year design-based research study investigating the potential of learning communities constructed around using Civilization III (a turn-based historical simulation-strategy game), the chapter argues that historical model construction is a compelling way to mediate one’s understandings about history. Participants in this game-based learning program developed new identities as producers as well as consumers of historical simulations. Two distinct trajectories of expertise were found to be emerging: one that developed around expert, systemic gaming (orienting toward the experience as a game system), and another that we call historical gaming, orienting to the game experience as a form of “replaying history.” Both forms have value, emphasizing different aspects of the game system. We believe that a community tying these two forms of gaming together (and other ones, as they emerge) is key for building robust learning environments.\n",

      "Paper Title: Applying Game Design Elements in the Workplace, Paper Abstract: Gamification, whereby users are engaged in pre-assigned activities induced by game elements, is gaining interest among researchers and practitioners. While it has been touted that enterprise gamified information systems (ISs) can successfully tempt users, ensuring sustainable user engagement has been identified as a major challenge for organizations that have adopted the gamification ideas. Despite the proliferation of enterprise social media with gamified applications, little research has empirically examined how gamification ideas generate practical values in the workplace. To fill this gap, drawing on cognitive evaluation theory and the theory of aesthetic experience, this study develops a theoretical model that explains how game dynamics influence an employee’s work engagement within an enterprise gamified IS. On the basis of the results of model test, we can discuss how different game dynamics (i.e., rewardbased and aesthetic-based dynamics) jointly influence users’ intrinsic motivation (enjoyment) to engage in work-related activities.\n",

      "Paper Title: miRLocator: Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Mature MicroRNAs within Plant Pre-miRNA Sequences, Paper Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding RNA that play regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological processes, such as plant growth and abiotic stress responses. Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species.\n",

      "Paper Title: Serious Games in Surgical Medical Education: A Virtual Emergency Department as a Tool for Teaching Clinical Reasoning to Medical Students, Paper Abstract: Background Serious games enable the simulation of daily working practices and constitute a potential tool for teaching both declarative and procedural knowledge. The availability of educational serious games offering a high-fidelity, three-dimensional environment in combination with profound medical background is limited, and most published studies have assessed student satisfaction rather than learning outcome as a function of game use. Objective This study aimed to test the effect of a serious game simulating an emergency department (“EMERGE”) on students’ declarative and procedural knowledge, as well as their satisfaction with the serious game. Methods This nonrandomized trial was performed at the Department of General, Visceral and Cancer Surgery at University Hospital Cologne, Germany. A total of 140 medical students in the clinical part of their training (5th to 12th semester) self-selected to participate in this experimental study. Declarative knowledge (measured with 20 multiple choice questions) and procedural knowledge (measured with written questions derived from an Objective Structured Clinical Examination station) were assessed before and after working with EMERGE. Students’ impression of the effectiveness and applicability of EMERGE were measured on a 6-point Likert scale. Results A pretest-posttest comparison yielded a significant increase in declarative knowledge. The percentage of correct answers to multiple choice questions increased from before (mean 60.4, SD 16.6) to after (mean 76.0, SD 11.6) playing EMERGE (P<.001). The effect on declarative knowledge was larger in students in lower semesters than in students in higher semesters (P<.001). Additionally, students’ overall impression of EMERGE was positive. Conclusions Students self-selecting to use a serious game in addition to formal teaching gain declarative and procedural knowledge.\n",

We report in this paper on our recent effort to create a publicly available database of the first three VTR frequency trajectories. The database contains a representative subset of the TEMIT corpus with respect to speaker, gender, dialect and phonetic context, with a total of 538 sentences. A Matlab-based labeling tool is developed, with high-resolution wideband spectrograms displayed to assist in visual identification of VTR frequency values which are then recorded via mouse clicks and local spline interpolation. Special attention is paid to VTR values during consonant-to-vowel (CV) and vowel-to-consonant (VC) transitions, and to speech segments with vocal tract anti-resonances. Using this database, we quantitatively assess two common automatic VTR tracking techniques in terms of their average tracking errors analyzed within each of the six major broad phonetic classes as well as during CV and VC transitions. The potential use of the VTR database for research in several areas of speech processing is discussed\n",

      "Paper Title: Game theory for cyber security, Paper Abstract: While there are significant advances in information technology and infrastructure which offer new opportunities, cyberspace is still far from completely secured. In many cases, the employed security solutions are ad hoc and lack a quantitative decision framework. While they are effective in solving the particular problems they are designed for, they generally fail to respond well in a dynamically changing scenario. To this end, we propose a holistic security approach in this paper. We find that game theory provides huge potential to place such an approach on a solid analytical setting. We consider the interaction between the attacks and the defense mechanisms as a game played between the attacker and the defender (system administrator). In particular, we propose a game theory inspired defense architecture in which a game model acts as the brain. We focus on one of our recently proposed game models, namely imperfect information stochastic game. Although this game model seems to be promising, it also faces new challenges which warrant future attention. We discuss our current ideas on extending this model to address such challenges.\n",

      "Paper Title: Measuring the Size of Large No-Limit Poker Games, Paper Abstract: In the eld of computational game theory, games are often compared in terms of their size. This can be measured in several ways, including the number of unique game states, the number of decision points, and the total number of legal actions over all decision points. These numbers are either known or estimated for a wide range of classic games such as chess and checkers. In the stochastic and imperfect information game of poker, these sizes are easily computed in \\limit\" games which restrict the players’ available actions, but until now had only been estimated for the more complicated \\no-limit\" variants. In this paper, we describe a simple algorithm for quickly computing the size of two-player no-limit poker games, provide an implementation of this algorithm, and present for the rst time precise counts of the number of game states, information sets, actions and terminal nodes in the no-limit poker games played in the Annual Computer Poker Competition.\n",

      "Paper Title: Model Checking in Multiplayer Games Development, Paper Abstract: Multiplayer computer games play a big role in the ever-growing entertainment industry. Being competitive in this industry means releasing the best possible software, and reliability is a key feature to win the market. Computer games are also actively used to simulate different robotic systems where reliability is even more important, and potentially critical. Traditional software testing approaches can check a subset of all the possible program executions, and they can never guarantee complete absence of errors in the source code. On the other hand, during more than twenty years, Model Checking has demonstrated to be a powerful instrument for formal verification of large hardware and software components. In this paper, we contribute with a novel approach to formally verify computer games. We propose a method of model construction that starts from a computer game description and utilizes Model Checking technique. We apply the method on a case study: the game Penguin Clash. Finally, an approach to game model reduction (and its implementation) is introduced in order to address the state explosion problem.\n",

      "Paper Title: Performance Evaluation of IoT Data Management Using MongoDB Versus MySQL Databases in Different Cloud Environments, Paper Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) introduces a new challenge for Database Management Systems (DBMS). In IoT, large numbers of sensors are used in daily lives. These sensors generate a huge amount of heterogeneous data that needs to be handled by the appropriate DBMS. The IoT has a challenge for the DBMS in evaluating how to store and manipulate a huge amount of heterogeneous data. DBMS can be categorized into two main types: The Relational DBMSs and the Non-relational DBMSs. This paper aims to provide a thorough comparative evaluation of two popular open-source DBMSs: MySQL as a Relational DBMS and MongoDB as a Non-relational DBMS. This comparison is based on evaluating the performance of inserting and retrieving a huge amount of IoT data and evaluating the performance of the two types of databases to work on resources with different specifications in cloud computing. This paper also proposes two prediction models and differentiates between them to estimate the response time in terms of the size of the database and the specifications of the cloud instance. These models help to select the appropriate DBMS to manage and store a certain size of data on an instance with particular specifications based on the estimated response time. The results indicate that MongoDB outperforms MySQL in terms of latency and the database size through increasing the amount of tested data. Moreover, MongoDB can save resources better than MySQL that needs resources with high capabilities to work with less performance.\n",

This is particularly evident when one focuses on allowing updates in logic programs. In this paper we propose a language DatalogA which is an extension of Datalog with updates to base relations. We define some procedural constructs to allow update programs to be written in an easy manner. The (W,p) scheme of Dynamic Logic fits nicely into the semantics of DatalogA programs in which W is taken to be the set of all possible states of the program and p is the accessibility relation between states. We give declarative semantics and equivalent constructed model semantics for DatalogA programs. We show that in the absence of updates our semantics reduce to the classical semantics of Datalog. Finally, we show some examples of non-stratified programs expressed in DatalogA.\n",

The Apache Unstructured Information Management applications (UIMA) framework is used in several projects, tools and resources, and has become a de facto standard in this area. Despite the multiple use of UIMA as a document-based schema, it does not provide native database support. In order to facilitate distributed storage and enable UIMA-based projects to perform targeted queries, we have developed the UIMA Database Interface (UIMA DI). UIMA DI sets up an environment for a generic use of UIMA documents in database systems. In addition, the integration of UIMA DI into rights and resource management tools enables user and group-speciﬁc access to UIMA documents and provides data protection. Finally, UIMA documents can be made accessible for third party programs. UIMA DI, which we evaluate in relation to ﬁle system-based storage, is available under the GPLv3 license via GitHub.\n",

      "Paper Title: Combining Machine Learning with Knowledge Engineering to detect Fake News in Social Networks - A Survey, Paper Abstract: Due to extensive spread of fake news on social and news media it became an emerging research topic now a days that gained attention. In the news media and social media the information is spread highspeed but without accuracy and hence detection mechanism should be able to predict news fast enough to tackle the dissemination of fake news. It has the potential for negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, detecting fake news on social media is important and also a technically challenging problem these days. We knew that Machine learning is helpful for building Artificial intelligence systems based on tacit knowledge because it can help us to solve complex problems due to real word data. On the other side we knew that Knowledge engineering is helpful for representing experts knowledge which people aware of that knowledge. Due to this we proposed that integration of Machine learning and knowledge engineering can be helpful in detection of fake news. In this paper we present what is fake news, importance of fake news, overall impact of fake news on different areas, different ways to detect fake news on social media, existing detections algorithms that can help us to overcome the issue, similar application areas and at the end we proposed combination of data driven and engineered knowledge to combat fake news. We studied and compared three different modules text classifiers, stance detection applications and fact checking existing techniques that can help to detect fake news. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of fake news on society. Experimental evaluation of publically available datasets and our proposed fake news detection combination can serve better in detection of fake news.\n",

      "Paper Title: Capture Database through Symbolization, Recognition and Generation of Motion Patterns, Paper Abstract: Motion capture systems are used to obtain motion data such that humanoid robots or computer graphics (CG) characters can behave naturally. However, it has proven to be hard not only to modify the capture data without losing its reality but also to search for the required capture data in a lot of capture data. In this paper, we provide a solution to these problems based on our previous work on symbolization of motion patterns for developing humanoid intelligence. Similar motion sequences in the database are abstracted as a symbol, which will be applied to searching motion patterns in the database similar to a given motion. This paper also introduces a method for building a stochastic symbol-word mapping model utilizing the word labels provided by the operator during motion capture sessions. This model converts a input sequence of words into a sequence of symbols, and then allows the capture database both to be searched for capture data corresponding to the input (a sequence of words) and to provide the users with new motion data generated by the symbols. Finally, we apply analogy of symbols to establishing the database in order to provide an appropriate motion data in response to an unsupervised sequence of words and then demonstrate the validity of analogy theory.\n",

      "Paper Title: Ontology searching and browsing at the Rat Genome Database, Paper Abstract: The Rat Genome Database (RGD) is the premier repository of rat genomic and genetic data and currently houses over 40 000 rat gene records, as well as human and mouse orthologs, 1857 rat and 1912 human quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 2347 rat strains. Biological information curated for these data objects includes disease associations, phenotypes, pathways, molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. RGD uses more than a dozen different ontologies to standardize annotation information for genes, QTLs and strains. That means a lot of time can be spent searching and browsing ontologies for the appropriate terms needed both for curating and mining the data. RGD has upgraded its ontology term search to make it more versatile and more robust. A term search result is connected to a term browser so the user can fine-tune the search by viewing parent and children terms. Most publicly available term browsers display a hierarchical organization of terms in an expandable tree format. RGD has replaced its old tree browser format with a ‘driller’ type of browser that allows quicker drilling up and down through the term branches, which has been confirmed by testing. The RGD ontology report pages have also been upgraded. Expanded functionality allows more choice in how annotations are displayed and what subsets of annotations are displayed. The new ontology search, browser and report features have been designed to enhance both manual data curation and manual data extraction.

The literature reviewed was inconclusive as to the relationship of using educational games for knowledge reinforcement and the amount of knowledge retained. The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between nutrition label knowledge retention and the game reinforcement methods of a peer-interactive board game or an individualized computer game. Fourteen classes of fifth graders (N=277) were taught nutrition label information prior to being put into the treatment groups. The study concluded that the peer-interactive board game reinforcement was significantly more effective than the other reinforcement methods.\n",

      "Paper Title: Experimenting with the Archive: STS-ers As Analysts and Co-constructors of Databases and Other Archival Forms, Paper Abstract: This article is about recent attempts by scholars, database practitioners, and curators to experiment in theoretically interesting ways with the conceptual design and the building of databases, archives, and other information systems. This article uses the term ‘‘archive’’ (following Derrida’s Archive Fever 1998/1995 and Bowker’s Memory Practices in the Sciences 2005) as an overarching category to include a diversity of technologies used to inventory objects and knowledge, to commit them to memory and for future use. The category of ‘‘archive’’ might include forms as diverse as the simple spreadsheet, the species inventory, the computerized database, and the museum. Using this protean concept, this study suggests that we are currently witnessing a time where close convergences are occurring between social theory and archive construction. It identifies a ‘‘move’’ toward exposure of the guts of our archives and databases, toward exposing the contingencies, the framing, the reflexivity, and the politics embedded within them. Within this move, the study examines ways in which theories of performance and emergence have begun to influence the way that archives of different kinds are conceived and reflects on the role of Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholars in their construction.\n",

      "Paper Title: Waiting for Something to Happen: Narratives, Interactivity and Agency and the Video Game Cut-scene, Paper Abstract: Since the appearance in 1978 of Adventure on the Atari 2600, the cut-scene (alternatively cutscene or cut scene) has been a key component to many video games. Often, the cut-scene gives narrative shape to the game experience, moving the player along through a series of events culminating in the story's end. Cybertheorists such as Hayles, Murray and Frasca have explored the ways in which digital interactive media and the video game introduce new paradigms of narrative and storytelling, as well new conceptions of interactivity and agency. However, in many ways the inclusion of cut-scenes raises many of the problems concerning the theoretical structures with which to investigate video games. Since cut-scenes often follow cinematic codes of representation, current theory often renders the cut-scene as passive and non-interactive, as opposed to the interactive nature of gameplay. Yet as film theory has shown, especially in the effects of suturing and such, cinema offers a kind of psychic interactivity that blurs the hard boundary often drawn between cinema and gameplay. The cut-scene then becomes the locus of the tension in video games between cinematic representation and gameplay, and subsequently, an investigation of the cut-scene and its role in the video game can offer substantial insight into the nature of agency and interactivity within the video game. Using the release of Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 and Ubisoft’s Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, both of which challenge the traditional definitions and uses of the cutscene, this paper will study the different ways in which the cut-scene operates within the video game. It will not only discuss current conceptions of agency and interactivity within the video game, but also offer an transmedia framework, after the work of Marsha Kinder, with which to explore the relationship between narrative and gameplay, cinema and simulation in the video game.\n",

      "Paper Title: Non-Cooperative Multicast and Facility Location Games, Paper Abstract: We consider a multicast game with selfish non- cooperative players. There is a special source node and each player is interested in connecting to the source by making a routing decision that minimizes its payment. The mutual influence of the players is determined by a cost sharing mechanism, which in our case evenly splits the cost of an edge among the players using it. We consider two different models: an integral model, where each player connects to the source by choosing a single path, and a fractional model, where a player is allowed to split the flow it receives from the source between several paths. In both models we explore the overhead incurred in network cost due to the selfish behavior of the users, as well as the computational complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium. The existence of a Nash equilibrium for the integral model was previously established by the means of a potential function. We prove that finding a Nash equilibrium that minimizes the potential function is NP-hard. We focus on the price of anarchy of a Nash equilibrium resulting from the best-response dynamics of a game course, where the players join the game sequentially. For a game with in players, we establish an upper bound of O(radicnlog2 n) on the price of anarchy, and a lower bound of Omega(log n/log log n). For the fractional model, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium via a potential function and give a polynomial time algorithm for computing an equilibrium that minimizes the potential function. Finally, we consider a weighted extension of the multicast game, and prove that in the fractional model, the game always has a Nash equilibrium.\n",

      "Paper Title: An Indexing and Retrieval Mechanism for Complex Similarity Queries in Image Databases, Paper Abstract: A content-based image retrieval mechanism to support complex similarity queries is presented. The image content is defined by three kinds of features: quantifiable features describing the visual information, nonquantifiable features describing the semantic information, and keywords describing more abstract semantic information. In correspondence with these feature sets, we construct three types of indexes: visual indexes, semantic indexes, and keyword indexes. Index structures are elaborated to provide effective and efficient retrieval of images based on their contents. The underlying index structure used for all indexes is the HG-tree. In addition to the HG-tree, the signature file and hashing technique are also employed to index keywords and semantic features. The proposed indexing scheme combines and extends the HG-tree, the signature file, and the hashing scheme to support complex similarity queries. We also propose a new evaluation strategy to process the complex similarity queries. Experiments have been carried out on large image collections to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval mechanism.\n",

More particularly, this research investigated the validity of the hypothesis that computer games are a particularly motivating means for young students to learn English vocabulary effectively in comparison to other approaches suggested by the Greek National Curriculum. The grade, in which this research was conducted, was the 4th grade of Primary school as it is a borderline grade in which greater demands are imposed on the students of this age group and language level regarding, mainly, their reading and writing skills as in this class, for the first time, it is explicitly stated by the national curriculum that literacy is one of the three basic axons upon which English language learning should be developed. All in all, the results of this research shed light on the effects which new technologies have on language learning as well as their ability to motivate students to learn English. The results of this research will also be used as a basis upon which specific suggestions for the practical implementation of computer games in the everyday classroom can be made.\n",

It has been argued that active and critical learning about rich semiotic systems, learning through learning communities and the complex problem-solving that good games involve, resemble science learning as being an active process of inquiry just as real life science practice. In this paper, I present the first studies from a test of the cross-disciplinary science educational game ‘Homicide’, a forensic investigation game developed at Learning Lab Denmark. The goal with Homicide is to use the game media to simulate an ‘authentic’ learning situation of science experts. In the game the players go through the process of inquiry similar to that of forensic experts. In this paper I present the first observations from a play test of Homicide and discuss the potential in this type of game-based learning spaces.\n",

The nodes, even if modeled as selfish, gain from such collaboration, in the sense that they can accomplish functionality and performance that is impossible to achieve without such collaboration. However, such gains from collaboration do not come for free. There are costs for such collaboration incurred by each node (e.g. energy consumption for forwarding other nodes packets). In this paper we use constrained coalitional games (i.e. collaborative dynamic games subject to constraints or costs for collaboration) to investigate several key problems in autonomic wireless networks including: network formation, efficient topologies and stability of coalitions.\n",

Assuming that the macrocell base station (MBS) protects itself by pricing the interference from femtocell users, a Stackelberg game is formulated to study the joint utility maximization of the macrocell and femtocells subject to a maximum tolerable interference power constraint at the MBS. Two practical femtocell network models are investigated: sparsely deployed scenario for rural areas and densely deployed scenario for urban areas. For each scenario, two pricing schemes: uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing, are proposed. The Stackelberg equilibriums for the proposed games are characterized, and an effective distributed interference price bargaining algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed for the uniform-pricing case. Numerical examples are presented to verify the proposed studies. It is shown that the proposed schemes are effective in resource allocation and macrocell protection for both the uplink and downlink transmissions in spectrum-sharing femtocell networks.\n",

      "Paper Title: Classification of Children’s Sitting Postures Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Paper Abstract: Sitting on a chair in an awkward posture or sitting for a long period of time is a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders. A postural habit that has been formed cannot be changed easily. It is important to form a proper postural habit from childhood as the lumbar disease during childhood caused by their improper posture is most likely to recur. Thus, there is a need for a monitoring system that classifies children’s sitting postures. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for classifying sitting postures for children using machine learning algorithms. The convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used in addition to the conventional algorithms: Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), decision tree (DT), neural network (NN), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). To collect data for classifying sitting postures, a sensing cushion was developed by mounting a pressure sensor mat (8 × 8) inside children’s chair seat cushion. Ten children participated, and sensor data was collected by taking a static posture for the five prescribed postures. The accuracy of CNN was found to be the highest as compared with those of the other algorithms. It is expected that the comprehensive posture monitoring system would be established through future research on enhancing the classification algorithm and providing an effective feedback system.\n",

      "Paper Title: Photorealistic Monocular Gaze Redirection Using Machine Learning, Paper Abstract: We propose a general approach to the gaze redirection problem in images that utilizes machine learning. The idea is to learn to re-synthesize images by training on pairs of images with known disparities between gaze directions. We show that such learning-based re-synthesis can achieve convincing gaze redirection based on monocular input, and that the learned systems generalize well to people and imaging conditions unseen during training. We describe and compare three instantiations of our idea. The first system is based on efficient decision forest predictors and redirects the gaze by a fixed angle in real-time (on a single CPU), being particularly suitable for the videoconferencing gaze correction. The second system is based on a deep architecture and allows gaze redirection by a range of angles. The second system achieves higher photorealism, while being several times slower. The third system is based on real-time decision forests at test time, while using the supervision from a “teacher” deep network during training. The third system approaches the quality of a teacher network in our experiments, and thus provides a highly realistic real-time monocular solution to the gaze correction problem. We present in-depth assessment and comparisons of the proposed systems based on quantitative measurements and a user study.\n",

      "Paper Title: Game-based Abstraction for Markov Decision Processes, Paper Abstract: In this paper we present a novel abstraction technique for Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are widely used for modelling systems that exhibit both probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviour. In the field of model checking, abstraction has proved an extremely successful tool to combat the state-space explosion problem. In the probabilistic setting, however, little practical progress has been made in this area. We propose an abstraction method for MDPs based on stochastic two-player games. The key idea behind this approach is to maintain a separation between nondeterminism present in the original MDP and nondeterminism introduced through abstraction, each type being represented by a different player in the game. Crucially, this allows us to obtain distinct lower and upper bounds for both the best and worst-case performance (minimum or maximum probabilities) of the MDP. We have implemented our techniques and illustrate their practical utility by applying them to a quantitative analysis of the Zeroconf dynamic network configuration protocol\n",

      "Paper Title: Early Detection of Aphid Infestation and Insect-Plant Interaction Assessment in Wheat Using a Low-Cost Electronic Nose (E-Nose), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Machine Learning Modeling, Paper Abstract: Advances in early insect detection have been reported using digital technologies through camera systems, sensor networks, and remote sensing coupled with machine learning (ML) modeling. However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.\n",

      "Paper Title: BCI Promises in Emotional Involvement in Music and Games, Paper Abstract: The reliability of commercial non-invasive BCI (brain computer Interface) devices and the lower cost of these EEG-based systems, as well as the equipment's portability, determined the increasing interest in their application in different research fields. The latter feature makes BCI devices particularly suited for entertainment applications, especially given the possibility to detect the mental state of the users. The relationship between emotions and entertainment is obvious, as is the influence of music in human emotional states. While BCI devices represent a challenge in gaming motion control, they have been successfully applied in music production [Dan et al. 2009] and composition [Hamadicharef et al. 2010]. In our previous work [Conscious and unconscious music from the brain in press] we focused on conscious production of music notes with the aim of developing a prototype for applications in entertainment. In this work we trace the state-of-the art of our research and present our opinion on possible applications of the preliminary results.\n",

      "Paper Title: O-Minimal Hybrid Reachability Games, Paper Abstract: In this paper, we consider reachability games over general hybrid systems, and distinguish between two possible observation frameworks for those games: either the precise dynamics of the system is seen by the players (this is the perfect observation framework), or only the starting point and the delays are known by the players (this is the partial observation framework). In the first more classical framework, we show that time-abstract bisimulation is not adequate for solving this problem, although it is sufficient in the case of timed automata . That is why we consider an other equivalence, namely the suffix equivalence based on the encoding of trajectories through words. We show that this suffix equivalence is in general a correct abstraction for games. We apply this result to o-minimal hybrid systems, and get decidability and computability results in this framework. For the second framework which assumes a partial observation of the dynamics of the system, we propose another abstraction, called the superword encoding, which is suitable to solve the games under that assumption. In that framework, we also provide decidability and computability results.\n",

Forwards, illustrations, references, index. 327 pp. $29.95 cloth. ISBN: 9780262162579Celia Pearce's Communities of Play is a fascinating, wide-ranging study relevant to anyone interested in online games and worlds, ethnography, or game studies. The book tells the story of a group of players who originally met in the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) Uru Prologue and their efforts to stay together after the game closed. This work is significant for three major reasons. First, it is a study of the processes that give rise to emergent behavior in MMOs, a topic of relevance to both game designers and sociologists. Second, the book is also one of very few studies addressing how a virtual world's closing affects its players. Finally, it contains an insightful analysis of the perks and perils of doing ethnography in an online community, an analysis that is invaluable for anyone considering a similar project.Uru Prologue was intended as the beta test for Uru Live, an MMO set in the popular Myst universe. Uru Live was canceled before release, however, and Uru Prologue closed on February 9, 2004. This closure marked both the end of the beta test, the cancellation of Uru Live, and the birth of what Pearce refers to as the \"Uru Diaspora,\" a group of players who now inhabit other online spaces but still identify as Uru-vians (p. 93). The book focuses on how one particular group of players known as \"The Gathering of Uru\" (TGU) reacted to the closing and attempted to stay together.One notable theoretical tool Pearce defines early in the book is a continuum of online game types, with \"fixed-synthetic worlds\" (such as Uru and World of Warcraft) at one end and \"co-created worlds\" (such as There.com and Second Life) at the other. In the former, users have few content-creation tools, while the latter emphasize user-created content. Pearce's continuum provides a useful means of analyzing how the emergent social behavior occurring in an MMO is shaped by the affordances and constraints placed on the player. (Here \"emergence\" refers to a phenomenon whereby complex systems organize themselves and act in unpredictable ways, while \"affordances and constraints\" refer to what a given MMO does and does not allow its users to do.) For members of the TGU, the affordances of co-created worlds such as There.com and Second Life enabled them to re-create environments and objects from Uru Prologue in other virtual worlds. Pearce's identification of this phenomenon offers game designers insight into how a virtual world can be designed to support varying kinds of emergent behavior among the players. …\n",

      "Paper Title: Natural language Interface for Database: A Brief review, Paper Abstract: Information is playing an important role in our lives. One of the major sources of information is databases. Databases and database technology are having major impact on the growing use of computers. Almost all IT applications are storing and retrieving information from databases. Retrieving information database requires knowledge of database languages like SQL. The Structured Query Language (SQL) norms are been pursued in almost all languages for relational database systems. However, not everybody is able to write SQL queries as they may not be aware of the structure of the database. So this has led to the development of Intelligent Database System ( IDBS) . There is an overwhelming need for non-expert users to query relational databases in their natural language instead of working with the values of the attributes. As a result many intelligent natural language interfaces to databases have been developed, which provides flexible options for manipulating queries. The idea of using Natural Language instead of SQL has prompted the development of new type of processing called Natural language Interface to Database. NLIDB is a step towards the development of intelligent database systems (IDBS) to enhance the users in performing flexible querying in databases. This paper is an introduction to Intelligent Database System and Natural Language Interface to Databases. Then a brief overview of NLIDB subcomponents is given and then discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures and various approaches for the development of NLIDB systems.\n",

      "Paper Title: Greedy and Linear Ensembles of Machine Learning Methods Outperform Single Approaches for QSPR Regression Problems, Paper Abstract: The application of Machine Learning to cheminformatics is a large and active field of research, but there exist few papers which discuss whether ensembles of different Machine Learning methods can improve upon the performance of their component methodologies. Here we investigated a variety of methods, including kernel‐based, tree, linear, neural networks, and both greedy and linear ensemble methods. These were all tested against a standardised methodology for regression with data relevant to the pharmaceutical development process. This investigation focused on QSPR problems within drug‐like chemical space. We aimed to investigate which methods perform best, and how the ‘wisdom of crowds’ principle can be applied to ensemble predictors. It was found that no single method performs best for all problems, but that a dynamic, well‐structured ensemble predictor would perform very well across the board, usually providing an improvement in performance over the best single method. Its use of weighting factors allows the greedy ensemble to acquire a bigger contribution from the better performing models, and this helps the greedy ensemble generally to outperform the simpler linear ensemble. Choice of data preprocessing methodology was found to be crucial to performance of each method too.\n",

Here, we present results of a genome-wide analysis of TRAP sequences and genome organization from application of TRAPDb, a relational database created for the collection, curation and analysis of TRAP sequences. This has revealed a specific enrichment in the number of TRAP transporters in several bacteria which is consistent with increased use of TRAP transporters in saline environments. Additionally, we report a number of new organizations of TRAP transporter genes and proteins which suggest the recruitment of TRAP transporter components for use in other biological contexts.\n",
